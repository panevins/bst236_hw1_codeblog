# BST 236 CodeBlog report

Create a homepage for a website for your **coding blog**. The website should be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can design the homepage by yourself in any proper style you like. You may need to make the design expandable to add more content from our future assignments. The link to the homepage should be added to the `README.md` of your homework repository so that anyone can access the homepage and the following two webpages from the Internet using this link.

1. Went to settings -> pages and deployed from main branch

2. asked AI copilot to generate a homepage for me. it created a file directory.

   *please create a homepage for my coding blog that can be opened via github pages, using css and html

   * please update the css to have a pale purple background and use a serif font, and so that body text is contained in white boxes 

   * I then requested a variety of small aesthetic changes, which I was able to implement myself. 

## making pacman

1. The first step was to create a webpage where pacman is. 

I asked

```
how do i add a page to my website where i can have a playable pacman game
```

It listed steps to create a directory, html, css, and javascript files.
However, the pacman game was not interactive: 'playable" was clearly not specific enough. 

2. Improving game functionality

* please make it so pacman changes direction when the arrow keys are pressed

(recommends some javascript changes)

* the game canvas should have a maze with white borders that pacman cannot cross. make a more complex maze with thinner walls.

(very simple maze)

* there should be white dots centered in the halls of the maze, and when pacman crosses them he eats them and they disappear for thirty seconds before reappearing

this did not work.
