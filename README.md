# BST 236 CodeBlog report

Create a homepage for a website for your **coding blog**. The website should be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can design the homepage by yourself in any proper style you like. You may need to make the design expandable to add more content from our future assignments. The link to the homepage should be added to the `README.md` of your homework repository so that anyone can access the homepage and the following two webpages from the Internet using this link.
