                    <h3>Assessment of evidence against homogeneity in exhaustive subgroup treatment effect plots</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Björn Bornkamp, Jiarui Lu, Frank Bretz</p>
                    <p>Exhaustive subgroup treatment effect plots are constructed by displaying all subgroup treatment effects of interest against subgroup sample size, providing a useful overview of the observed treatment effect heterogeneity in a clinical trial. As in any exploratory subgroup analysis, however, the observed estimates suffer from small sample sizes and multiplicity issues. To facilitate more interpretable exploratory assessments, this paper introduces a computationally efficient method to generate homogeneity regions within exhaustive subgroup treatment effect plots. Using the Doubly Robust (DR) learner, pseudo-outcomes are used to estimate subgroup effects and derive reference distributions, quantifying how surprising observed heterogeneity is under a homogeneous effects model. Explicit formulas are derived for the homogeneity region and different methods for calculation of the critical values are compared. The method is illustrated with a cardiovascular trial and evaluated via simulation, showing well-calibrated inference and improved performance over standard approaches using simple differences of observed group means.</p>

                    <h3>E-values for Adaptive Clinical Trials: Anytime-Valid Monitoring in Practice</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandra Sokolova, Vadim Sokolov</p>
                    <p>Adaptive clinical trials rely on interim analyses, flexible stopping, and data-dependent design modifications that complicate statistical guarantees when fixed-horizon test statistics are repeatedly inspected or reused after adaptations. E-values and e-processes provide anytime-valid tests and confidence sequences that remain valid under optional stopping and optional continuation without requiring a prespecified monitoring schedule.
  This paper is a methodology guide for practitioners. We develop the betting-martingale construction of e-processes for two-arm randomized controlled trials, show how e-values naturally handle composite null hypotheses and support futility monitoring, and provide guidance on when e-values are appropriate, when established alternatives are preferable, and how to integrate e-value monitoring with group sequential and Bayesian adaptive workflows.
  A numerical study compares five monitoring rules -- naive and calibrated versions of frequentist, Bayesian, and e-value approaches -- in a two-arm binary-endpoint trial. Naive repeated testing and naive posterior thresholds inflate Type I error substantially under frequent interim looks. Among the valid methods, the calibrated group sequential rule achieves the highest power, the e-value rule provides robust anytime-valid control with moderate power, and the calibrated Bayesian rule is the most conservative.
  Extended simulations show that the power gap between group sequential and e-value methods depends on the monitoring schedule and reverses under continuous monitoring. The methodology, including futility monitoring, platform trial multiplicity control, and hybrid strategies combining e-values with established methods, is implemented in the open-source R package `evalinger` and situated within the regulatory framework of the January 2026 FDA draft guidance on Bayesian methodology.</p>

                    <h3>Modeling the Hazard Function with Non-linear Systems in Dynamical Survival Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dananjani Liyanage, Mahmudul Bari Hridoy, Fahad Mostafa</p>
                    <p>Hazard functions play a central role in survival analysis, offering insight into the underlying risk dynamics of time to event data, with broad applications in medicine, epidemiology, and related fields. First order ordinary differential equation (ODE) formulations of the hazard function have been explored as extensions beyond classical parametric models. However, such approaches typically produce monotonic hazard patterns, limiting their ability to represent oscillatory behavior, nonlinear damping, or coupled growth decay dynamics. We propose a new statistical framework for modeling and simulating hazard functions governed by higher-order ODEs, allowing risk to depend on both its current level, its rate of change, and time. This class of models captures complex time dependent risk behaviors relevant to survival analysis and reliability studies. We develop a simulation procedure by reformulating the higher order ODE as a system of nonlinear first order equations solved numerically, with failure times generated via cumulative hazard inversion. Likelihood based inference under right censoring is also developed, and moment generating function analysis is used to characterize tail behavior. The proposed framework is evaluated through simulation studies and illustrated using real world survival data, where oscillatory hazard dynamics capture temporal risk patterns beyond standard monotone models.</p>

                    <h3>Design-Conditional Prior Elicitation for Dirichlet Process Mixtures: A Unified Framework for Cluster Counts and Weight Control</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> JoonHo Lee</p>
                    <p>Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models are widely used for semiparametric Bayesian analysis in educational and behavioral research, yet specifying the concentration parameter remains a critical barrier. Default hyperpriors often impose strong, unintended assumptions about clustering, while existing calibration methods based on cluster counts suffer from computational inefficiency and fail to control the distribution of mixture weights. This article introduces Design-Conditional Elicitation (DCE), a unified framework that translates practitioner beliefs about cluster structure into coherent Gamma hyperpriors for a fixed design size J. DCE makes three contributions. First, it solves the computational bottleneck using Two-Stage Moment Matching (TSMM), which couples a closed-form approximation with an exact Newton refinement to calibrate hyperparameters without grid search. Second, addressing the "unintended prior" phenomenon, DCE incorporates a Dual-Anchor protocol to diagnose and optionally constrain the risk of weight dominance while transparently reporting the resulting trade-off against cluster-count fidelity. Third, the complete workflow is implemented in the open-source DPprior R package with reproducible diagnostics and a reporting checklist. Simulation studies demonstrate that common defaults such as Gamma(1, 1) induce posterior collapse rates exceeding 60% regardless of the true cluster structure, while DCE-calibrated priors substantially reduce bias and improve recovery across varying levels of data informativeness.</p>

                    <h3>Latent variation in pathogen strain-specific effects under multiple-versions-of-treatment theory</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bronner P. Gonçalves</p>
                    <p>Evidence-informed policy on infections requires estimates of their effects on health. However, pathogenic variation, whereby occurrence of adverse outcomes depends on the infecting strain, might complicate the study of many infectious agents. Here, we consider the interpretation of epidemiologic studies on effects of infections on health when there is heterogeneity in strain-specific effects and information on strain composition is unavailable. We use potential outcomes and causal inference theory for analyses in the presence of multiple versions of treatment to argue that oft-reported quantities in these studies have a causal interpretation that depends on population frequencies of infecting strains. Moreover, as in other contexts where the treatment-variation-irrelevance assumption might be violated, transportability requires additional considerations, beyond those needed for non-compound exposures. This discussion, that considers potential heterogeneity in strain-specific effects, will facilitate interpretation of these studies, and for the reasons mentioned above, also highlights the value of pathogen subtype data.</p>

                    <h3>Evaluating Predictive Modeling Strategies for Predicting Individual Treatment Effects in Precision Medicine</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pamela M. Chiroque-Solano, M Lee Van Horn, Thomas Jaki</p>
                    <p>Precision medicine seeks to match patients with treatments that produce the greatest benefit. The Predicted Individual Treatment Effect (PITE)-the difference between predicted outcomes under treatment and control-quantifies this benefit but is difficult to estimate due to unobserved counterfactuals, high dimensionality, and complex interactions. We compared 30+ modeling strategies, including penalized and projection-based methods, flexible learners, and tree-ensembles, using a structured simulation framework varying sample size, dimensionality, multicollinearity, and interaction complexity. Performance was measured using root mean squared error (RMSE) for prediction accuracy and directional accuracy (DIR) for correctly classifying benefit versus harm. Internal validation produced optimistic estimates, whereas external validation with distributional shifts and higher-order interactions more clearly revealed model weaknesses. Penalized and projection-based approaches-ridge, lasso, elastic net, partial least squares (PLS), and principal components regression (PCR)-consistently achieved strong RMSE and DIR performance. Flexible learners excelled only under strong signals and sufficient sample sizes. Results highlight robust linear/projection defaults and the necessity of rigorous external validation.</p>

                    <h3>Non-Linear Drivers of Population Dynamics: a Nonparametric Coalescent Approach</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Monti, Nuno R. Faria, Xiang Ji, Philippe Lemey, Moritz U. G. Kraemer, Marc A. Suchard</p>
                    <p>Effective population size (Ne(t)) is a fundamental parameter in population genetics and phylodynamics that quantifies genetic diversity and reveals demographic history. Coalescent-based methods enable the inference of Ne(t) trajectories through time from phylogenies reconstructed from molecular sequence data. Understanding the ecological and environmental drivers of population dynamics requires linking Ne(t) to external covariates. Existing approaches typically impose log-linear relationships between covariates and Ne(t), which may fail to capture complex biological processes and can introduce bias when the true relationship is nonlinear. We present a flexible Bayesian framework that integrates covariates into coalescent models with piecewise-constant Ne(t) through a Gaussian process (GP) prior. The GP, a distribution over functions, naturally accommodates nonlinear covariate effects without restrictive parametric assumptions. This formulation improves estimation of covariate-Ne(t) relationships, mitigates bias under nonlinear associations, and yields interpretable uncertainty quantification that varies across the covariate space. To balance global covariate-driven patterns with local temporal dynamics, we couple the GP prior with a Gaussian Markov random field that enforces smoothness in Ne(t) trajectories. Through simulation studies and three empirical applications - yellow fever virus dynamics in Brazil (2016-2018), late-Quaternary musk ox demography, and HIV-1 CRF02-AG evolution in Cameroon - we demonstrate that our method both confirms linear relationships where appropriate and reveals nonlinear covariate effects that would otherwise be missed or mischaracterized. This framework advances phylodynamic inference by enabling more accurate and biologically realistic modeling of how environmental and epidemiological factors shape population size through time.</p>

                    <h3>Early warning of Mpox outbreaks in U.S. jurisdictions using Lasso Vector Autoregression models with cross-jurisdictional lags</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannah Craddock, Joel O. Wertheim, Eliah Aronoff-Spencer, Mark Beatty, David Valentine, Rishi Graham, Jade C. Wang, Lior Rennert, Seema Shah, Ravi Goyal, Natasha K. Martin</p>
                    <p>Mpox is an orthopoxvirus that infects humans and animals and is transmitted primarily through close physical contact. The episodic and spatially heterogeneous dynamics of Mpox transmission underscores the need for timely, area-specific forecasts to support targeted public health responses in the U.S. We develop a Vector Autoregression model with Lasso regularization (VAR-Lasso) to generate rolling two-week-ahead forecasts of weekly Mpox cases for eight high-incidence U.S. jurisdictions using national surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The VAR-Lasso model identifies significant long-lag, cross-jurisdictional predictors. For a case study in San Diego County (SDC), these statistical predictors align with phylogenetic analysis that traces a 2023 cluster in SDC to an outbreak in Illinois six months earlier. As the need for public health action is often greatest when incidence is increasing, our performance evaluation focuses on positive-slope weighted error metrics. Forecast performance of the VAR-Lasso model is compared to a uni-variate Auto-Regressive (AR) Lasso model and a naive moving-average estimate. The models are compared using slope-weighted Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), slope-weighted Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and slope-weighted bias. Across all observations, the VAR-Lasso model reduces slope-weighted RMSE, MAE, and bias by 12%, 7%, and 66% relative to the AR model, and by 16%, 13%, and 76% relative to the naive benchmark. Our findings highlight the value of sparse multivariate time-series models that leverage cross-jurisdictional case data for early forecasting of Mpox outbreaks. Such forecasting can aid health departments in proactively providing timely resources and messaging to mitigate the risks of a future outbreak.</p>

                    <h3>A Bayesian approach to differential prevalence analysis with applications in microbiome studies</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juho Pelto, Kari Auranen, Janne V. Kujala, Leo Lahti</p>
                    <p>Recent evidence suggests that analyzing the presence/absence of taxonomic features can offer a compelling alternative to differential abundance analysis in microbiome studies. However, standard approaches face challenges with boundary cases and multiple testing. To address these challenges, we developed DiPPER (Differential Prevalence via Probabilistic Estimation in R), a method based on Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We benchmarked our method against existing differential prevalence and abundance methods using data from 67 publicly available human gut microbiome studies. We observed considerable variation in performance across methods, with DiPPER outperforming alternatives by combining high sensitivity with effective error control. DiPPER also demonstrated superior replication of findings across independent studies. Furthermore, DiPPER provides differential prevalence estimates and uncertainty intervals that are inherently adjusted for multiple testing.</p>

                    <h3>Selecting Hyperparameters for Tree-Boosting</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Floris Jan Koster, Fabio Sigrist</p>
                    <p>Tree-boosting is a widely used machine learning technique for tabular data. However, its out-of-sample accuracy is critically dependent on multiple hyperparameters. In this article, we empirically compare several popular methods for hyperparameter optimization for tree-boosting including random grid search, the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), Gaussian-process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), Hyperband, the sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC) method, and deterministic full grid search using $59$ regression and classification data sets. We find that the SMAC method clearly outperforms all the other considered methods. We further observe that (i) a relatively large number of trials larger than $100$ is required for accurate tuning, (ii) using default values for hyperparameters yields very inaccurate models, (iii) all considered hyperparameters can have a material effect on the accuracy of tree-boosting, i.e., there is no small set of hyperparameters that is more important than others, and (iv) choosing the number of boosting iterations using early stopping yields more accurate results compared to including it in the search space for regression tasks.</p>
