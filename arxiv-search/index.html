                    <h3>Crime in Proportions: Applying Compositional Data Analysis to European
  Crime Trends for 2022</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Onur Batın Doğan, Fatma Sevinç Kurnaz</p>
                    <p>  This article investigates crime patterns across European countries in 2022
using Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) to address limitations of traditional
statistical approaches in dealing with the relative nature of crime data.
Recognizing crime types as components of a whole, we employ CoDA to explore
relationships between different crime categories while respecting their
inherent interdependencies. The study utilizes k-means clustering to group
countries based on their crime profiles, identifying three distinct clusters
largely aligning with geographical locations. This clustering is visualized
through t-SNE and geographic mapping, revealing regional similarities. Further
analysis using Robust Principal Component Analysis on identified crime clusters
reveals insightful relationships between specific crime types, such as
homicide, smuggling, and financial crimes, and how their prevalence varies
across countries. The findings reveals distinct crime patterns across Europe,
highlighting regional commonalities while also highlighting divergences like
Norway and Latvia that deviate from their expected geographical
classifications. Moreover, the study identifies specific crime groups; for
example, it pairs countries high in corruption and smuggling, such as Austria,
with those countries that exhibit a higher relevance to homicide and smuggling,
such as Luxembourg. It also points to the presence of financial crimes like
fraud in countries such as Romania and Estonia.

                    <h3>Seamless short- to mid-term probabilistic wind power forecasting</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Dantas, Jethro Browell</p>
                    <p>  This paper presents a method for probabilistic wind power forecasting that
quantifies and integrates uncertainties from weather forecasts and
weather-to-power conversion. By addressing both uncertainty sources, the method
achieves state-of-the-art results for lead times of 6 to 162 hours, eliminating
the need for separate models for short- and mid-term forecasting. It also
improves short-term forecasts during high weather uncertainty periods, which
methods based on deterministic weather forecasts fail to capture. The study
reveals that weather-to-power uncertainty is more significant for short-term
forecasts, while weather forecast uncertainty dominates mid-term forecasts,
with the transition point varying between wind farms. Offshore farms typically
see this shift at shorter lead times than onshore ones. The findings are
supported by an extensive, reproducible case study comprising 73 wind farms in
Great Britain over five years.

                    <h3>On a Semiparametric Stochastic Volatility Model</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yudong Feng, Ashis Gangopadhyay</p>
                    <p>  This paper presents a novel approach to stochastic volatility (SV) modeling
by utilizing nonparametric techniques that enhance our ability to capture the
volatility of financial time series data, with a particular emphasis on the
non-Gaussian behavior of asset return distributions. Although traditional
parametric SV models can be useful, they often suffer from restrictive
assumptions regarding errors, which may inadequately represent extreme values
and tail behavior in financial returns. To address these limitations, we
propose two semiparametric SV models that use data to better approximate error
distributions. To facilitate the computation of model parameters, we developed
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating model parameters and
volatility dynamics. Simulations and empirical tests on S&P 500 data indicate
that nonparametric models can minimize bias and variance in volatility
estimation, providing a more accurate reflection of market expectations about
volatility. This methodology serves as a promising alternative to conventional
parametric models, improving precision in financial risk assessment and
deepening our understanding of the volatility dynamics of financial returns.

                    <h3>Searching for Low-Mass Exoplanets Amid Stellar Variability with a Fixed
  Effects Linear Model of Line-by-Line Shape Changes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Salzer, Jessi Cisewski-Kehe, Eric B. Ford, Lily L. Zhao</p>
                    <p>  The radial velocity (RV) method, also known as Doppler spectroscopy, is a
powerful technique for exoplanet discovery and characterization. In recent
years, progress has been made thanks to the improvements in the quality of
spectra from new extreme precision RV spectrometers. However, detecting the RV
signals of Earth-like exoplanets remains challenging, as the spectroscopic
signatures of low-mass planets can be obscured or confused with intrinsic
stellar variability. Changes in the shapes of spectral lines across time can
provide valuable information for disentangling stellar activity from true
Doppler shifts caused by low-mass exoplanets. In this work, we present a fixed
effects linear model to estimate RV signals that controls for changes in line
shapes by aggregating information from hundreds of spectral lines. Our
methodology incorporates a wild-bootstrap approach for modeling uncertainty and
cross-validation to control for overfitting. We evaluate the model's ability to
remove stellar activity using solar observations from the NEID spectrograph, as
the sun's true center-of-mass motion is precisely known. Including line
shape-change covariates reduces the RV root-mean-square errors by approximately
70% (from 1.919 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.575 m s$^{-1}$) relative to using only the
line-by-line Doppler shifts. The magnitude of the residuals is significantly
less than that from traditional CCF-based RV estimators and comparable to other
state-of-the-art methods for mitigating stellar variability.

                    <h3>Forecasting Italian daily electricity generation disaggregated by
  geographical zones and energy sources using coherent forecast combination</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Girolimetto, Tommaso Di Fonzo</p>
                    <p>  A novel approach is applied for improving forecast accuracy and achieving
coherence in forecasting the Italian daily energy generation time series. In
hierarchical frameworks such as national energy generation disaggregated by
geographical zones and energy sources, independently generated base forecasts
often result in inconsistencies across the constraints. We deal with this issue
through a coherent balanced multi-task forecast combination approach, which
combines unbiased forecasts from multiple experts while ensuring coherence.
Applied to the daily Italian electricity generation data, our method shows
superior accuracy compared to single-task base and combined forecasts, and a
state-of-the-art single-expert reconciliation technique, demonstrating to be an
effective approach to forecasting linearly constrained multiple time series.

  combination approach</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Girolimetto, Tommaso Di Fonzo</p>
                    <p>  We propose a quick-and-simple procedure to augment the accuracy of 15-minutes
Italian load forecasts disaggregated by bidding zones published by Terna, the
operator of the Italian electricity system. We show that a stacked-regression
multi-task combination approach using Terna and daily random walk naive
forecasts, is able to produce significantly more accurate forecasts immediately
after Terna publishes on its data portal the energy load measurements for the
previous day, and the forecasts for the current day.

                    <h3>A Diagnostic to Find and Help Combat Positivity Issues - with a Focus on
  Continuous Treatments</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katharina Ring, Michael Schomaker</p>
                    <p>  The positivity assumption is central in the identification of a causal
effect, yet is rarely discussed, especially in conjunction with continuous
treatments or Modified Treatment Policies. One common recommendation for
dealing with a violation is to change the estimand. However, an applied
researcher is faced with two problems: First, how can she tell whether there is
a positivity violation given her estimand of interest, preferably without
having to estimate a model first? Second, if she finds a problem with
positivity, how should she change her estimand in order to arrive at an
estimand which does not face the same issues? We suggest a novel diagnostic
which allows the researcher to answer both questions by providing insights into
how well an estimation for a certain estimand can be made for each observation
using the data at hand. We provide a simulation study on the general behaviour
of different MTPs at different levels of positivity violations and show how the
diagnostic helps understand where bias is to be expected. We illustrate the
application of our proposed diagnostic in a pharmacoepidemiological study based
on data from CHAPAS-3, a trial comparing different treatment regimens for
children living with HIV.

                    <h3>Comparison of Offset and Ratio Weighted Regressions in Tweedie Models
  with Application to Mid-Term Cancellations</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boucher Jean-Philippe, Coulibaly Raïssa</p>
                    <p>  In property and casualty insurance, particularly in automobile insurance,
risk exposure is traditionally associated with the coverage duration. However,
factors such as early contract cancellations demand more precise modelling to
ensure accurate premium pricing. This study introduces and compares two
approaches for modelling total claims (or loss costs) in insurance portfolios
with a high proportion of policies that have partial year exposure: the offset
and ratio methods. We demonstrate that both approaches can be viewed as
weighted regressions under the Tweedie distribution framework. Through an
analysis based on the financial balance property, we find that the ratio
approach outperforms the offset method. This comparison is illustrated using an
automobile insurance portfolio, where a significant share of policyholders
terminate their contracts before the coverage period concludes.

                    <h3>Stochastic Block Covariance Matrix Estimation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunran Chen, Surya T Tokdar, Jennifer M Groh</p>
                    <p>  Motivated by a neuroscience application we study the problem of statistical
estimation of a high-dimensional covariance matrix with a block structure. The
block model embeds a structural assumption: the population of items (neurons)
can be divided into latent sub-populations with shared associative covariation
within blocks and shared associative or dis-associative covariation across
blocks. Unlike the block diagonal assumption, our block structure incorporates
positive or negative pairwise correlation between blocks. In addition to
offering reasonable modeling choices in neuroscience and economics, the block
covariance matrix assumption is interesting purely from the perspective of
statistical estimation theory: (a) it offers in-built dimension reduction and
(b) it resembles a regularized factor model without the need of choosing the
number of factors. We discuss a hierarchical Bayesian estimation method to
simultaneously recover the latent blocks and estimate the overall covariance
matrix. We show with numerical experiments that a hierarchical structure and a
shrinkage prior are essential to accurate recovery when several blocks are
present.

                    <h3>Advances in Bayesian Modeling: Applications and Methods</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifei Yan, Juan Sosa, Carlos A. Martínez</p>
                    <p>  This paper explores the versatility and depth of Bayesian modeling by
presenting a comprehensive range of applications and methods, combining Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and variational approximations. Covering
topics such as hierarchical modeling, spatial modeling, higher-order Markov
chains, and Bayesian nonparametrics, the study emphasizes practical
implementations across diverse fields, including oceanography, climatology,
epidemiology, astronomy, and financial analysis. The aim is to bridge
theoretical underpinnings with real-world applications, illustrating the
formulation of Bayesian models, elicitation of priors, computational
strategies, and posterior and predictive analyses. By leveraging different
computational methods, this paper provides insights into model fitting,
goodness-of-fit evaluation, and predictive accuracy, addressing computational
efficiency and methodological challenges across various datasets and domains.
