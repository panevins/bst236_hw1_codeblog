                    <h3>A New Statistical Approach to Calibration-Free Localization Using
  Unlabeled Crowdsourced Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haozhou Hu, Harpreet S. Dhillon, R. Michael Buehrer</p>
                    <p>  Fingerprinting-based indoor localization methods typically require
labor-intensive site surveys to collect signal measurements at known reference
locations and frequent recalibration, which limits their scalability. This
paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel approach for indoor
localization that utilizes crowdsourced data {\em without location labels}. We
leverage the statistical information of crowdsourced data and propose a
cumulative distribution function (CDF) based distance estimation method that
maps received signal strength (RSS) to distances from access points. This
approach overcomes the limitations of conventional distance estimation based on
the empirical path loss model by efficiently capturing the impacts of shadow
fading and multipath. Compared to fingerprinting, our {\em unsupervised}
statistical approach eliminates the need for signal measurements at known
reference locations. The estimated distances are then integrated into a
three-step framework to determine the target location. The localization
performance of our proposed method is evaluated using RSS data generated from
ray-tracing simulations. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in
localization accuracy compared to methods based on the empirical path loss
model. Furthermore, our statistical approach, which relies on unlabeled data,
achieves localization accuracy comparable to that of the {\em supervised}
approach, the $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) algorithm, which requires
fingerprints with location labels. For reproducibility and future research, we
make the ray-tracing dataset publicly available at [2].

                    <h3>Going green across boundaries: Spatial effects of environmental policies
  on tourism flows</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Gianluigi Serio, Diego Giuliani, Maria Michela Dickson, Giuseppe Espa</p>
                    <p>  This study investigates the relationship between environmental sustainability
policies and tourism flows across Italian provinces using a Spatial Durbin
Error Model (SDEM) within a gravity framework. By incorporating both public and
corporate environmental initiatives, the analysis highlights the direct and
spatial spillover effects of sustainability measures on tourism demand. The
findings indicate that corporate-led initiatives, such as ecocertifications and
green investments, exert a stronger direct influence on tourism flows compared
to public measures, underscoring the visibility and immediate impact of private
sector actions. However, both types of initiatives generate significant
positive spatial spillovers, suggesting that sustainability efforts extend
beyond local boundaries. These results demonstrate the interconnected nature of
regional tourism systems and emphasize the critical role of coordinated
sustainability policies in fostering tourism growth while promoting
environmental protection. By addressing the spatial interdependencies of
tourism flows and sustainability practices, this research provides valuable
insights for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to improve sustainable
tourism development at regional and national levels.

                    <h3>evalprob4cast: An R-package for evaluation of ensembles as probabilistic
  forecasts or event forecasts</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathias Blicher Bjerregård, Jethro Browell, John Zack, Jan Kloppenborg Møller, Henrik Madsen, Gregor Giebel, Corinna Möhrlen</p>
                    <p>  For any forecasting application, evaluation of forecasts is an important
task. For example, in the field of renewable energy sources there is high
variability and uncertainty of power production, which makes forecasting and
the evaluation hereof crucial both for power trading and power grid balancing.
In particular, probabilistic forecasts represented by ensembles are popular due
to their ability to cover the full range of scenarios that can occur, thus
enabling forecast users to make more informed decisions than what would be
possible with simple deterministic forecasts. The selection of open source
software that supports evaluation of ensemble forecasts, and especially event
detection, is currently limited. As a solution, evalprob4cast is a new
R-package for probabilistic forecast evaluation that aims to provide its users
with all the tools needed for the assessment of ensemble forecasts, in the form
of metrics and visualization methods. Both univariate and multivariate
probabilistic forecasts as well as event detection are covered. Furthermore, it
offers a user-friendly design where all of the evaluation methods can be
applied in a fast and easy way, as long as the input data is organized in
accordance with the format defined by the package. While its development is
motivated by forecasting of renewables, the package can be used for any
application with ensemble forecasts.

                    <h3>Target Prediction Under Deceptive Switching Strategies via
  Outlier-Robust Filtering of Partially Observed Incomplete Trajectories</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiming Meng, Dongchang Li, Melkior Ornik</p>
                    <p>  Motivated by a study on deception and counter-deception, this paper addresses
the problem of identifying an agent's target as it seeks to reach one of two
targets in a given environment. In practice, an agent may initially follow a
strategy to aim at one target but decide to switch to another midway. Such a
strategy can be deceptive when the counterpart only has access to imperfect
observations, which include heavily corrupted sensor noise and possible
outliers, making it difficult to visually identify the agent's true intent. To
counter deception and identify the true target, we utilize prior knowledge of
the agent's dynamics and the imprecisely observed partial trajectory of the
agent's states to dynamically update the estimation of the posterior
probability of whether a deceptive switch has taken place. However, existing
methods in the literature have not achieved effective deception identification
within a reasonable computation time. We propose a set of outlier-robust change
detection methods to track relevant change-related statistics efficiently,
enabling the detection of deceptive strategies in hidden nonlinear dynamics
with reasonable computational effort. The performance of the proposed framework
is examined for Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) detection under deceptive
strategies using random simulations in the kinematics model with external
forcing.

                    <h3>Spatiotemporal causal inference with arbitrary spillover and carryover
  effects</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mitsuru Mukaigawara, Kosuke Imai, Jason Lyall, Georgia Papadogeorgou</p>
                    <p>  Micro-level data with granular spatial and temporal information are becoming
increasingly available to social scientists. Most researchers aggregate such
data into a convenient panel data format and apply standard causal inference
methods. This approach, however, has two limitations. First, data aggregation
results in the loss of detailed geo-location and temporal information, leading
to potential biases. Second, most panel data methods either ignore spatial
spillover and temporal carryover effects or impose restrictive assumptions on
their structure. We introduce a general methodological framework for
spatiotemporal causal inference with arbitrary spillover and carryover effects.
Under this general framework, we demonstrate how to define and estimate causal
quantities of interest, explore heterogeneous treatment effects, investigate
causal mechanisms, and visualize the results to facilitate their
interpretation. We illustrate the proposed methodology through an analysis of
airstrikes and insurgent attacks in Iraq. The open-source software package
geocausal implements all of our methods.

                    <h3>Scalable Fitting Methods for Multivariate Gaussian Additive Models with
  Covariate-dependent Covariance Matrices</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Gioia, Matteo Fasiolo, Ruggero Bellio, Simon N. Wood</p>
                    <p>  We propose efficient computational methods to fit multivariate Gaussian
additive models, where the mean vector and the covariance matrix are allowed to
vary with covariates, in an empirical Bayes framework. To guarantee the
positive-definiteness of the covariance matrix, we model the elements of an
unconstrained parametrisation matrix, focussing particularly on the modified
Cholesky decomposition and the matrix logarithm. A key computational challenge
arises from the fact that, for the model class considered here, the number of
parameters increases quadratically with the dimension of the response vector.
Hence, here we discuss how to achieve fast computation and low memory footprint
in moderately high dimensions, by exploiting parsimonious model structures,
sparse derivative systems and by employing block-oriented computational
methods. Methods for building and fitting multivariate Gaussian additive models
are provided by the SCM R package, available at
https://github.com/VinGioia90/SCM, while the code for reproducing the results
in this paper is available at https://github.com/VinGioia90/SACM.

                    <h3>Bayesian LSTM for indoor temperature modeling</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma Hannula, Arttu Häkkinen, Antti Solonen, Felibe Uribe, Jana de Wiljes, Lassi Roininen</p>
                    <p>  Improving energy efficiency of building heating systems is essential for
reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional
control methods in buildings rely on static heating curves based solely on
outdoor temperature measurements, neglecting system state and free heat sources
like solar gain. Model predictive control (MPC) not only addresses these
limitations but further optimizes heating control by incorporating weather
forecasts and system state predictions. However, current industrial MPC
solutions often use simplified physics-inspired models, which compromise
accuracy for interpretability. While purely data-driven models offer better
predictive performance, they face challenges like overfitting and lack of
transparency.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
architecture for indoor temperature modeling. Our experiments across 100
real-world buildings demonstrate that the Bayesian LSTM outperforms an
industrial physics-based model in predictive accuracy, enabling potential for
improved energy efficiency and thermal comfort if deployed in heating MPC
solutions. Over deterministic black-box approaches, the Bayesian framework
provides additional advantages by improving generalization ability and allowing
interpretation of predictions via uncertainty quantification. This work
advances data-driven heating control by balancing predictive performance with
the transparency and reliability required for real-world heating MPC
applications.

                    <h3>A model-free feature extraction procedure for interval-valued time
  series prediction</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wan Tian, Zhongfeng Qin, Tao Hu</p>
                    <p>  In this paper, we present a novel feature extraction procedure to predict
interval-valued time series by combing transfer learning and imaging
approaches. Initially, we represent interval-valued time series using a
bivariate point-valued time series, which serves as a representative form. We
first transform each time series into images by employing various imaging
approaches such as recurrence plot, gramian angular summation/difference field,
and Markov transition field, and construct an image dataset by treating each
imaging method's output as a separate class. Based on this dataset, we train
several candidates for a feature extraction network (FEN), specifically ResNet
with varying layers. Then we choose the penultimate layer of the FEN to extract
the most relevant features from the transformed images. We integrate the
extracted features into conventional predictive models to formulate the
corresponding prediction models. To formulate prediction, we integrate the
extracted features into a regular prediction model. The proposed methods are
evaluated based on the S\&P 500 index and three data-generating processes
(DGPs), and the experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement in
prediction performance compared to existing methods.

                    <h3>Bayesian sequential analysis of adverse events with binary data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayue Wang, Ben Boukai</p>
                    <p>  We propose a Bayesian Sequential procedure to test hypotheses concerning the
Relative Risk between two specific treatments based on the binary data obtained
from the two-arm clinical trial. Our development is based on the optimal
sequential test of \citet{wang2024early}, which is cast within the Bayesian
framework. This approach enables us to provide, in a straightforward manner
based on the Stopping Rule Principle (SRP), an assessment of the various error
probabilities via posterior probabilities and conditional error probabilities.
Additionally, we present the connection to the notion of the Uniformly Most
Powerful Bayesian Test (UMPBT). To illustrate our procedure, we utilized the
data from \citet{silva2020optimal} to analyze the results obtained from the
standard Bayesian and the modified Bayesian test of \citet{berger1997unified}
under several different prior distributions of the parameters involved.

  in Neuromorphic Pixels</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron J. Hendrickson, David P. Haefner</p>
                    <p>  A novel continuous-time framework is proposed for modeling neuromorphic image
sensors in the form of an initial canonical representation with analytical
tractability. Exact simulation algorithms are developed in parallel with
closed-form expressions that characterize the model's dynamics. This framework
enables the generation of synthetic event streams in genuine continuous-time,
which combined with the analytical results, reveal the underlying mechanisms
driving the oscillatory behavior of event data presented in the literature.
