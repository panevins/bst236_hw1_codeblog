                    <h3>Revisiting Optimal Proportions for Binary Responses: Insights from
  Incorporating the Absent Perspective of Type-I Error Rate Control</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Pin, Sofía S. Villar, William F. Rosenberger</p>
                    <p>  This work revisits optimal response-adaptive designs from a type-I error rate
perspective, highlighting when and how much these allocations exacerbate type-I
error rate inflation - an issue previously undocumented. We explore a range of
approaches from the literature that can be applied to reduce type-I error rate
inflation. However, we found that all of these approaches fail to give a robust
solution to the problem. To address this, we derive two optimal proportions,
incorporating the more robust score test (instead of the Wald test) with finite
sample estimators (instead of the unknown true values) in the formulation of
the optimization problem. One proportion optimizes statistical power and the
other minimizes the total number failures in a trail while maintaining a
predefined power level. Through simulations based on an early-phase and a
confirmatory trial we provide crucial practical insight into how these new
optimal proportion designs can offer substantial patient outcomes advantages
while controlling type-I error rate. While we focused on binary outcomes, the
framework offers valuable insights that naturally extend to other outcome
types, multi-armed trials and alternative measures of interest.

                    <h3>Gaussian Process-driven Hidden Markov Models for Early Diagnosis of
  Infant Gait Anomalies</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Torres-Torres F., Jonatan Arias-García, Hernán F. García, Andrés F. López-Lopera, Jesús F. Vargas-Bonilla</p>
                    <p>  Gait analysis is critical in the early detection and intervention of motor
neurological disorders in infants. Despite its importance, traditional methods
often struggle to model the high variability and rapid developmental changes
inherent to infant gait. To address these challenges, we propose a
probabilistic Gaussian Process (GP)-driven Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture
the complex temporal dynamics of infant gait cycles and enable automatic
recognition of gait anomalies. We use a Multi-Output GP (MoGP) framework to
model interdependencies between multiple gait signals, with a composite kernel
designed to account for smooth, non-smooth, and periodic behaviors exhibited in
gait cycles. The HMM segments gait phases into normal and abnormal states,
facilitating the precise identification of pathological movement patterns in
stance and swing phases. The proposed model is trained and assessed using a
dataset of infants with and without motor neurological disorders via
leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results demonstrate that the MoGP
outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based neural networks in modeling
gait dynamics, offering improved accuracy, variance explanation, and temporal
alignment. Further, the predictive performance of MoGP provides a principled
framework for uncertainty quantification, allowing confidence estimation in
gait trajectory predictions. Additionally, the HMM enhances interpretability by
explicitly modeling gait phase transitions, improving the detection of subtle
anomalies across multiple gait cycles. These findings highlight the MoGP-HMM
framework as a robust automatic gait analysis tool, allowing early diagnosis
and intervention strategies for infants with neurological motor disorders.

                    <h3>Predicting Energy Demand with Tensor Factor Models</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mattia Banin, Matteo Barigozzi, Luca Trapin</p>
                    <p>  Hourly consumption from multiple providers displays pronounced intra-day,
intra-week, and annual seasonalities, as well as strong cross-sectional
correlations. We introduce a novel approach for forecasting high-dimensional
U.S. electricity demand data by accounting for multiple seasonal patterns via
tensor factor models. To this end, we restructure the hourly electricity demand
data into a sequence of weekly tensors. Each weekly tensor is a three-mode
array whose dimensions correspond to the hours of the day, the days of the
week, and the number of providers. This multi-dimensional representation
enables a factor decomposition that distinguishes among the various seasonal
patterns along each mode: factor loadings over the hour dimension highlight
intra-day cycles, factor loadings over the day dimension capture differences
across weekdays and weekends, and factor loadings over the provider dimension
reveal commonalities and shared dynamics among the different entities. We
rigorously compare the predictive performance of our tensor factor model
against several benchmarks, including traditional vector factor models and
cutting-edge functional time series methods. The results consistently
demonstrate that the tensor-based approach delivers superior forecasting
accuracy at different horizons and provides interpretable factors that align
with domain knowledge. Beyond its empirical advantages, our framework offers a
systematic way to gain insight into the underlying processes that shape
electricity demand patterns. In doing so, it paves the way for more nuanced,
data-driven decision-making and can be adapted to address similar challenges in
other high-dimensional time series applications.

                    <h3>Uncertainty-Aware Adaptation of Large Language Models for
  Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanket Jantre, Tianle Wang, Gilchan Park, Kriti Chopra, Nicholas Jeon, Xiaoning Qian, Nathan M. Urban, Byung-Jun Yoon</p>
                    <p>  Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) helps derive cellular
mechanistic understanding, particularly in the context of complex conditions
such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in predicting
protein structures and interactions via automated mining of vast biomedical
literature; yet their inherent uncertainty remains a key challenge for deriving
reproducible findings, critical for biomedical applications. In this study, we
present an uncertainty-aware adaptation of LLMs for PPI analysis, leveraging
fine-tuned LLaMA-3 and BioMedGPT models. To enhance prediction reliability, we
integrate LoRA ensembles and Bayesian LoRA models for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), ensuring confidence-calibrated insights into protein
behavior. Our approach achieves competitive performance in PPI identification
across diverse disease contexts while addressing model uncertainty, thereby
enhancing trustworthiness and reproducibility in computational biology. These
findings underscore the potential of uncertainty-aware LLM adaptation for
advancing precision medicine and biomedical research.

                    <h3>Soccer Goalkeeper Performance Evaluation: Clustering Approach</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahdi Teimouri</p>
                    <p>  The objective of this work was to help the soccer field managers to evaluate
the performance of a goalkeeper in saving the penalty kicks. To this end, based
on the concept of clustering, four measures were proposed for evaluating the
goalkeeper's performance in terms of both the saved kicks and detecting the
direction of kicked ball. The well-known measures ignore the goalkeeper's
ability in detecting the directional jump, while the forth proposed measure in
this work was regarded this fact. The effectiveness of the proposed measures
were analyzed and demonstrated by evaluating the performance of goalkeepers
participated in four important soccer matches. The results were consistent with
the proposed measures. In summary, as well as the known point statistics for
evaluating the performance of goalkeeper, the measures were proposed in this
work that regard as well the ability of goalkeeper in detecting the direction
of kicks are also suggested.

                    <h3>Multi-scale Masked Autoencoder for Electrocardiogram Anomaly Detection</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya Zhou, Yujie Yang, Jianhuang Gan, Xiangjie Li, Jing Yuan, Wei Zhao</p>
                    <p>  Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is a fundamental tool for diagnosing
cardiovascular conditions, yet anomaly detection in ECG signals remains
challenging due to their inherent complexity and variability. We propose
Multi-scale Masked Autoencoder for ECG anomaly detection (MMAE-ECG), a novel
end-to-end framework that effectively captures both global and local
dependencies in ECG data. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that rely on
heartbeat segmentation or R-peak detection, MMAE-ECG eliminates the need for
such pre-processing steps, enhancing its suitability for clinical deployment.
MMAE-ECG partitions ECG signals into non-overlapping segments, with each
segment assigned learnable positional embeddings. A novel multi-scale masking
strategy and multi-scale attention mechanism, along with distinct positional
embeddings, enable a lightweight Transformer encoder to effectively capture
both local and global dependencies. The masked segments are then reconstructed
using a single-layer Transformer block, with an aggregation strategy employed
during inference to refine the outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while
significantly reducing computational complexity-approximately 1/78 of the
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for inference. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the
potential of multi-scale masked autoencoders for anomaly detection.

                    <h3>A state-space framework for causal detection of hippocampal
  ripple-replay events</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sirui Zeng, Uri T. Eden</p>
                    <p>  Hippocampal ripple-replay events are typically identified using a two-step
process that at each time point uses past and future data to determine whether
an event is occurring. This prevents researchers from identifying these events
in real time for closed-loop experiments. It also prevents the identification
of periods of nonlocal representation that are not accompanied by large changes
in the spectral content of the local field potentials (LFPs). In this work, we
present a new state-space model framework that is able to detect concurrent
changes in the rhythmic structure of LFPs with nonlocal activity in place cells
to identify ripple-replay events in a causal manner. The model combines latent
factors related to neural oscillations, represented space, and switches between
coding properties to explain simultaneously the spiking activity from multiple
units and the rhythmic content of LFPs recorded from multiple sources. The
model is temporally causal, meaning that estimates of the switching state can
be made at each instant using only past information from the spike and LFP
signals, or can be combined with future data to refine those estimates. We
applied this model framework to simulated and real hippocampal data to
demonstrate its performance in identifying ripple-replay events.

                    <h3>Overcoming data challenges to measure whole-person health in electronic
  health records</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarah C. Lotspeich, Sheetal Kedar, Rabeya Tahir, Aidan D. Keleghan, Amelia Miranda, Stephany N. Duda, Mike Bancks, Brian J. Wells, Ashish K. Khanna, Joseph Rigdon</p>
                    <p>  The allostatic load index (ALI) is a composite measure of whole-person
health. Data from electronic health records (EHR) present a huge opportunity to
operationalize the ALI in the learning health system, except they are prone to
missingness and errors. Validation of EHR data (e.g., through chart reviews)
can provide better-quality data, but realistically, only a subset of patients'
data can be validated, and most protocols do not recover missing data. Using a
representative sample of 1000 patients from the EHR at an extensive learning
health system (100 of whom could be validated), we propose methods to design,
conduct, and analyze statistically efficient and robust studies of the ALI and
healthcare utilization. With semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation, we
robustly incorporate all available data into statistical models. Using targeted
design strategies, we examine ways to select the most informative patients for
validation. Incorporating clinical expertise, we devise a novel validation
protocol to promote the quality and completeness of EHR data. Validating the
EHR data uncovered relatively low error rates and recovered some missing data.
Through simulation studies based on preliminary data, residual sampling was
identified as the most informative strategy for completing our validation
study. Statistical models of partially validated data indicated higher odds of
engaging in the healthcare system were associated with worse whole-person
health (i.e., higher ALI), adjusting for age. Targeted validation with an
enriched protocol allowed us to ensure the quality and promote the completeness
of the EHR. Findings from our validation study were incorporated into analyses
as we operationalize the ALI as a whole-person health measure intended to
predict healthcare utilization in the academic learning health system.

                    <h3>Pulling back the curtain: the road from statistical estimand to
  machine-learning based estimator for epidemiologists (no wizard required)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Audrey Renson, Lina Montoya, Dana E. Goin, Iván Díaz, Rachael K. Ross</p>
                    <p>  Epidemiologists increasingly use causal inference methods that rely on
machine learning, as these approaches can relax unnecessary model specification
assumptions. While deriving and studying asymptotic properties of such
estimators is a task usually associated with statisticians, it is useful for
epidemiologists to understand the steps involved, as epidemiologists are often
at the forefront of defining important new research questions and translating
them into new parameters to be estimated. In this paper, our goal was to
provide a relatively accessible guide through the process of (i) deriving an
estimator based on the so-called efficient influence function (which we define
and explain), and (ii) showing such an estimator's ability to validly
incorporate machine learning, by demonstrating the so-called rate double
robustness property. The derivations in this paper rely mainly on algebra and
some foundational results from statistical inference, which are explained.

  States: A Machine Learning Approach</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brittany Antonczak, Meg Fay, Aviral Chawla, Gregory Rowangould</p>
                    <p>  The Highway Performance Monitoring System, managed by the Federal Highway
Administration, provides essential data on average annual daily traffic across
U.S. roadways, but it has limited representation of medium- and heavy-duty
vehicles on non-interstate roads. This gap limits research and policy analysis
on the impacts of truck traffic, especially concerning air quality and public
health. To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium-
and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results
in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic
density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution
exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated,
provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental
and health impacts. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning,
public health research, and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the effects of
truck traffic on vulnerable communities exposed to air pollution.
