                    <h3>Design loads for wave impacts -- introducing the Probabilistic Adaptive Screening (PAS) method for predicting extreme non-linear loads on maritime structures</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanne M. van Essen, Harleigh C. Seyffert</p>
                    <p>To ensure the safety of marine and coastal structures, extreme (design) values should be known at the design stage. But for such complex systems, estimating the magnitude of events which are both non-linear and rare is extremely challenging, and involves considerable computational cost to capture the high-fidelity physics. To address this challenge, we offer a new multi-fidelity screening method, Probabilistic Adaptive Screening (PAS), which accurately predicts extreme values of strongly non-linear wave-induced loads while minimising the required high-fidelity simulation duration. The method introduces a probabilistic approach to multi-fidelity screening, allowing efficient linear potential flow indicators to be used in the low-fidelity stage, even for strongly non-linear load cases. The method is validated against a range of cases, including non-linear waves, and ship vertical bending moments, green water impact loads, and slamming loads. It can be concluded that PAS accurately estimates both the short-term distributions and extreme values in all test cases, with most probable maximum (MPM) values within 10\% of the available full brute-force Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) results. In addition, PAS achieves this performance very efficiently, requiring less than 4\% of the high-fidelity simulation time needed for conventional MCS. These results demonstrate that PAS can reliably reproduce the statistics of both weakly and strongly non-linear extreme load problems, while significantly reducing the associated computational cost. The present study validates the statistical PAS framework; further work should focus on validating the full procedure including CFD load simulations, and on validating it for long-term extremes.</p>

                    <h3>The Bayesian optimal two-stage design for clinical phase II trials based on Bayes factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riko Kelter, Samuel Pawel</p>
                    <p>Sequential trial design is an important statistical approach to increase the efficiency of clinical trials. Bayesian sequential trial design relies primarily on conducting a Monte Carlo simulation under the hypotheses of interest and investigating the resulting design characteristics via Monte Carlo estimates. This approach has several drawbacks, namely that replicating the calibration of a Bayesian design requires repeating a possibly complex Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, Monte Carlo standard errors are required to judge the reliability of the simulation. All of this is due to a lack of closed-form or numerical approaches to calibrate a Bayesian design which uses Bayes factors. In this paper, we propose the Bayesian optimal two-stage design for clinical phase II trials based on Bayes factors. The optimal two-stage Bayes factor design is a sequential clinical trial design that is built on the idea of trinomial tree branching, a method we propose to correct the resulting design characteristics for introducing a single interim analysis. We build upon this idea to invent a calibration algorithm which yields the optimal Bayesian design that minimizes the expected sample size under the null hypothesis. Examples show that our design recovers Simon's two-stage optimal design as a special case, improves upon non-sequential Bayesian design based on Bayes factors, and can be calibrated quickly, as it makes use only of standard numerical techniques instead of time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the design allows to ensure a minimum probability on compelling evidence in favour of the null hypothesis, which is not possible with other designs. As the idea of trinomial tree branching is neither dependent on the endpoint, nor on the use of Bayes factors, the design can therefore be generalized to other settings, too.</p>

                    <h3>Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization Framework for CFD-Based Non-Premixed Burner Design</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Souza Lima, Paulo Roberto Santana dos Reis, Alex Álisson Bandeira Santos, Ehecatl Antonio del Río Chanona, Idelfonso Bessa dos Reis Nogueira</p>
                    <p>We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO) framework that integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations with Gaussian-process surrogates to efficiently navigate the accuracy-cost trade-off induced by mesh resolution. The design vector x = [h, l, s] (height, length, and mesh element size) defines a continuous fidelity index Z(h, l, s), enabling the optimizer to adaptively combine low- and high-resolution simulations. This framework is applied to a non-premixed burner configuration targeting improved thermal efficiency under hydrogen-enriched fuels. A calibrated runtime model t_hat(h, l, s) penalizes computationally expensive queries, while a constrained noisy expected improvement (qNEI) guides sampling under an emissions cap of 2e-6 for NOx.
  Surrogates trained on CFD data exhibit stable hyperparameters and physically consistent sensitivities: mean temperature increases with reactor length and fidelity and is weakly negative with height; NOx grows with temperature yet tends to decrease with length. The best design achieves T_bar approx 2.0e3 K while satisfying the NOx limit.
  Relative to a hypothetical single-fidelity campaign (Z = 1), the MF-BO achieves comparable convergence with about 57 percent lower total wall time by learning the design landscape through fast low-Z evaluations and reserving high-Z CFD for promising candidates. Overall, the methodology offers a generalizable and computationally affordable path for optimizing reacting-flow systems in which mesh-driven fidelity inherently couples accuracy, cost, and emissions. This highlights its potential to accelerate design cycles and reduce resource requirements in industrial burner development and other high-cost CFD-driven applications.</p>

                    <h3>What If They Took the Shot? A Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Counterfactual Expected Goals</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikayil Mahmudlu, Oktay Karakuş, Hasan Arkadaş</p>
                    <p>This study develops a hierarchical Bayesian framework that integrates expert domain knowledge to quantify player-specific effects in expected goals (xG) estimation, addressing a limitation of standard models that treat all players as identical finishers. Using 9,970 shots from StatsBomb's 2015-16 data and Football Manager 2017 ratings, we combine Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors to stabilise player-level estimates, especially for players with few shots. The hierarchical model reduces posterior uncertainty relative to weak priors and achieves strong external validity: hierarchical and baseline predictions correlate at R2 = 0.75, while an XGBoost benchmark validated against StatsBomb xG reaches R2 = 0.833. The model uncovers interpretable specialisation profiles, including one-on-one finishing (Aguero, Suarez, Belotti, Immobile, Martial), long-range shooting (Pogba), and first-touch execution (Insigne, Salah, Gameiro). It also identifies latent ability in underperforming players such as Immobile and Belotti. The framework supports counterfactual "what-if" analysis by reallocating shots between players under identical contexts. Case studies show that Sansone would generate +2.2 xG from Berardi's chances, driven largely by high-pressure situations, while Vardy-Giroud substitutions reveal strong asymmetry: replacing Vardy with Giroud results in a large decline (about -7 xG), whereas the reverse substitution has only a small effect (about -1 xG). This work provides an uncertainty-aware tool for player evaluation, recruitment, and tactical planning, and offers a general approach for domains where individual skill and contextual factors jointly shape performance.</p>

                    <h3>A novel method to analyze pattern shifts in rainfall using cluster analysis and probability models</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Singh, Aaditya Jadhav, Abha Goyal, Jesma V, Vyshna I C</p>
                    <p>: One of the prominent challenges being faced by agricultural sciences is the onset of climate change which is adversely affecting every aspect of cropping. Modelling of climate change at macro level have been carried out at large scale and there is ample amount of research publications available for that. But at micro level like at state level or district level there are lesser studies. District level studies can help in preparing specific plans for the mitigation of adverse effects of climate change at local level. An attempt has been made in this paper to model the monthly rainfall of Varanasi district of the state of Uttar Pradesh with the help of probability models. Firstly, the pattern of the climate change over 122 years has been unveiled by using exploratory analysis and using multivariate techniques like cluster analysis and then probability models have been fitted for selected months</p>

                    <h3>The Hidden AI Race: Tracking Environmental Costs of Innovation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shyam Agarwal, Mahasweta Chakraborti</p>
                    <p>The past decade has seen a massive rise in the popularity of AI systems, mainly owing to the developments in Gen AI, which has revolutionized numerous industries and applications. However, this progress comes at a considerable cost to the environment as training and deploying these models consume significant computational resources and energy and are responsible for large carbon footprints in the atmosphere. In this paper, we study the amount of carbon dioxide released by models across different domains over varying time periods. By examining parameters such as model size, repository activity (e.g., commits and repository age), task type, and organizational affiliation, we identify key factors influencing the environmental impact of AI development. Our findings reveal that model size and versioning frequency are strongly correlated with higher emissions, while domain-specific trends show that NLP models tend to have lower carbon footprints compared to audio-based systems. Organizational context also plays a significant role, with university-driven projects exhibiting the highest emissions, followed by non-profits and companies, while community-driven projects show a reduction in emissions. These results highlight the critical need for green AI practices, including the adoption of energy-efficient architectures, optimizing development workflows, and leveraging renewable energy sources. We also discuss a few practices that can lead to a more sustainable future with AI, and we end this paper with some future research directions that could be motivated by our work. This work not only provides actionable insights to mitigate the environmental impact of AI but also poses new research questions for the community to explore. By emphasizing the interplay between sustainability and innovation, our study aims to guide future efforts toward building a more ecologically responsible AI ecosystem.</p>

                    <h3>The Causal Uncertainty Principle</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel D. Reidpath</p>
                    <p>This paper explains why internal and external validity cannot be simultaneously maximised. It introduces "evidential states" to represent the information available for causal inference and shows that routine study operations (restriction, conditioning, and intervention) transform these states in ways that do not commute. Because each operation removes or reorganises information differently, changing their order yields evidential states that support different causal claims. This non-commutativity creates a structural trade-off: the steps that secure precise causal identification also eliminate the heterogeneity required for generalisation. Small model, observational and experimental examples illustrate how familiar failures of transportability arise from this order dependence. The result is a concise structural account of why increasing causal precision necessarily narrows the world to which findings apply.</p>

                    <h3>Mapping urban air quality using mobile and fixed low cost sensors: a model comparison</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yacine Mohamed Idir, Olivier Orfila, Patrice Chatellier, Vincent Judalet, Valentin Guaffre</p>
                    <p>This study addresses the critical challenge of modeling and mapping urban air quality to ascertain pollutant concentrations in unmonitored locations. The advent of low-cost sensors, particularly those deployed in vehicular networks, presents novel datasets that hold the potential to enhance air quality modeling. This research conducts a comprehensive review of ten statistical models drawn from existing literature, using both fixed and mobile low-cost sensor data, alongside ancillary variables, within the urban confines of Nantes, France.
  Employing a methodology that includes cross-validation of data from low-cost sensors and validation on fixed air quality monitoring stations, this paper evaluates the models' performance in scenarios of temporal interpolation and prediction. Our findings reveal a pronounced bias in the model outputs when reliant on low-cost sensor data compared to the verification data obtained from fixed stations. Furthermore, machine learning models demonstrated superior performance in predictive scenarios, suggesting their enhanced suitability for forecasting tasks.
  The study conclusively indicates that reliance solely on data from low-cost mobile sensors compromises the reliability of air quality models, due to significant accuracy deficiencies. Consequently, we advocate for a directed focus towards the integration and calibration of low-cost sensor data with information from fixed monitoring stations. This approach, rather than an exclusive emphasis on the complexity of statistical modeling techniques, is pivotal for achieving the precision required for effective air quality management and policy-making.</p>

                    <h3>Spatial constraints improve filtering of measurement noise from animal tracks</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre Delporte, Susanne Ditlevsen, Adeline Samson</p>
                    <p>Advances in tracking technologies for animal movement require new statistical tools to better exploit the increasing amount of data. Animal positions are usually calculated using the GPS or Argos satellite system and include potentially complex non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed measurement error patterns. Errors are usually handled through a Kalman filter algorithm, which can be sensitive to non-Gaussian error distributions.
  In this paper, we introduce a realistic latent movement model through an underdamped Langevin stochastic differential equation (SDE) that includes an additional drift term to ensure that the animal remains in a known spatial domain of interest. This can be applied to aquatic animals moving in water or terrestrial animals moving in a restricted zone delimited by fences or natural barriers. We demonstrate that the incorporation of these spatial constraints into the latent movement model improves the accuracy of filtering for noisy observations of the positions. We implement an Extended Kalman Filter as well as a particle filter adapted to non-Gaussian error distributions. Our filters are based on solving the SDE through splitting schemes to approximate the latent dynamic.</p>

                    <h3>Probabilistic Digital Twin for Misspecified Structural Dynamical Systems via Latent Force Modeling and Bayesian Neural Networks</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahil Kashyap, Rajdip Nayek</p>
                    <p>This work presents a probabilistic digital twin framework for response prediction in dynamical systems governed by misspecified physics. The approach integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable end-to-end uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. In the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are treated as latent input forces to a nominal linear dynamical system and jointly estimated with system states using GPLFM from sensor measurements. A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins. The framework is demonstrated using four nonlinear examples: a single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator, a multi-DOF system, and two established benchmarks -- the Bouc-Wen hysteretic system and the Silverbox experimental dataset -- highlighting its predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification.</p>
