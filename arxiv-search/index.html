                    <h3>Demystifying AI in Criminal Justice</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard Berk</p>
                    <p>  There is widespread confusion among criminal justice practitioners and legal
scholars about the use of artificial intelligence in criminal justice. This
didactic review is written for readers with little or no background in
statistics or computer science. It is not intended to replace more technical
treatments. It is intended to supplement them and encourage readers to dig more
deeply into topics that strike their fancy.

                    <h3>Nonparametric Linear Discriminant Analysis for High Dimensional
  Matrix-Valued Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungyeon Oh, Seongoh Park, Hoyoung Park</p>
                    <p>  This paper addresses classification problems with matrix-valued data, which
commonly arises in applications such as neuroimaging and signal processing.
Building on the assumption that the data from each class follows a matrix
normal distribution, we propose a novel extension of Fisher's Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) tailored for matrix-valued observations. To
effectively capture structural information while maintaining estimation
flexibility, we adopt a nonparametric empirical Bayes framework based on
Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NPMLE), applied to vectorized and
scaled matrices. The NPMLE method has been shown to provide robust, flexible,
and accurate estimates for vector-valued data with various structures in the
mean vector or covariance matrix. By leveraging its strengths, our method is
effectively generalized to the matrix setting, thereby improving classification
performance. Through extensive simulation studies and real data applications,
including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
existing approaches across a variety of data structures.

                    <h3>Deep Neural Network Driven Simulation Based Inference Method for Pole
  Position Estimation under Model Misspecification</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Sadasivan, Isaac Cordero, Andrew Graham, Cecilia Marsh, Daniel Kupcho, Melana Mourad, Maxim Mai</p>
                    <p>  Simulation Based Inference (SBI) is shown to yield more accurate resonance
parameter estimates than traditional chi-squared minimization in certain cases
of model misspecification, demonstrated through a case study of pi-pi
scattering and the rho(770) resonance. Models fit to some data sets using
chi-squared minimization can predict inaccurate pole positions for the
rho(770), while SBI provides more robust predictions across the same models and
data. This result is significant both as a proof of concept that SBI can handle
model misspecification, and because accurate modeling of pi-pi scattering is
essential in the study of many contemporary physical systems (e.g., a1(1260),
omega(782)).

                    <h3>Cure Rate Joint Model for Time-to-Event Data and Longitudinal Tumor
  Burden with Potential Change Points</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixiang Qu, Ethan M. Alt, Weibin Zhong, Jeen Liu, Chenguang Wang, Joseph G. Ibrahim</p>
                    <p>  In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical trials, tumor burden (TB) is a
key longitudinal biomarker for assessing treatment effects. Typically,
standard-of-care (SOC) therapies and some novel interventions initially
decrease TB; however, many patients subsequently experience an
increase-indicating disease progression-while others show a continuous decline.
In patients with an eventual TB increase, the change point marks the onset of
progression and must occur before the time of the event. To capture these
distinct dynamics, we propose a novel joint model that integrates time-to-event
and longitudinal TB data, classifying patients into a change-point group or a
stable group. For the change-point group, our approach flexibly estimates an
individualized change point by leveraging time-to-event information. We use a
Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm for efficient parameter
estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate that our model outperforms
traditional approaches by accurately capturing diverse disease progression
patterns and handling censoring complexities, leading to robust marginal TB
outcome estimates. When applied to a Phase 3 NSCLC trial comparing cemiplimab
monotherapy to SOC, the treatment group shows prolonged TB reduction and
consistently lower TB over time, highlighting the clinical utility of our
approach. The implementation code is publicly available on
https://github.com/quyixiang/JoCuR.

                    <h3>An omnibus goodness-of-fit test based on trigonometric moments</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alain Desgagné, Frédéric Ouimet</p>
                    <p>  We present a versatile omnibus goodness-of-fit test based on the first two
trigonometric moments of probability-integral-transformed data, which rectifies
the covariance scaling errors made by Langholz and Kronmal [J. Amer. Statist.
Assoc. 86 (1991), 1077--1084]. Once properly scaled, the quadratic-form
statistic asymptotically follows a $\chi_2^2$ distribution under the null
hypothesis. The covariance scalings and parameter estimators are provided for
$32$ null distribution families, covering heavy-tailed, light-tailed,
asymmetric, and bounded-support cases, so the test is ready to be applied
directly. Using recent advances in non-degenerate multivariate $U$-statistics
with estimated nuisance parameters, we also showcase its asymptotic
distribution under local alternatives for three specific examples. Our
procedure shows excellent power; in particular, simulations testing the Laplace
model against a range of $400$ alternatives reveal that it surpasses all $40$
existing tests for moderate to large sample sizes. A real-data application
involving 48-hour-ahead surface temperature forecast errors further
demonstrates the practical utility of the test. To ensure full reproducibility,
the R code that generated our numerical results is publicly accessible online.

                    <h3>Bayesian Deep Gaussian Processes for Correlated Functional Data: A Case
  Study in Cosmological Matter Power Spectra</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephen A. Walsh, Annie S. Booth, David Higdon, Jared Clark, Kelly R. Moran, Katrin Heitmann</p>
                    <p>  Understanding the structure of our universe and the distribution of matter is
an area of active research. As cosmological surveys grow in complexity, the
development of emulators to efficiently and effectively predict matter power
spectra is essential. We are particularly motivated by the Mira-Titan Universe
simulation suite that, for a specified cosmological parameterization (termed a
"cosmology"), provides multiple response curves of various fidelities,
including correlated functional realizations. Our objective is two-fold. First,
we estimate the underlying true matter power spectra, with appropriate
uncertainty quantification (UQ), from all of the provided curves. To this end,
we propose a novel Bayesian deep Gaussian process (DGP) hierarchical model
which synthesizes all the simulation information to estimate the underlying
matter power spectra while providing effective UQ. Our model extends previous
work on Bayesian DGPs from scalar responses to correlated functional outputs.
Second, we leverage our predicted power spectra from various cosmologies in
order to accurately predict the entire matter power spectra for an unobserved
cosmology. For this task, we use basis function representations of the
functional spectra to train a separate Gaussian process emulator. Our method
performs well in synthetic exercises and against the benchmark cosmological
emulator (Cosmic Emu).

                    <h3>Index insurance under demand and solvency constraints</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Lopez, Daniel Nkameni</p>
                    <p>  Index insurance is often proposed to reduce protection gaps, especially for
emerging risks. Unlike traditional insurance, it bases compensation on a
measurable index, enabling faster payouts and lower claim management costs.
This approach benefits both policyholders, through quick payments, and
insurers, through reduced costs and better risk control due to reliable data
and robust statistical estimates. An important difference with the concept of
Cat Bonds is that the feasibility of such coverage relies on the possibility of
mutualization. Mutualization, in turn, is achieved only if a sufficiently high
number of policyholders agree to subscribe. The purpose of this paper is to
introduce a model for the demand for index insurance and to provide conditions
under which the solvency of the portfolio is achieved. From these conditions,
we deduce a product that combines index and traditional indemnity insurance in
order to benefit from the best of both approaches.

                    <h3>Identifying Neural Connectivity using Bernoulli Autoregressive Partially
  Linear Additive Models</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carla Pinkney, Carolina Euan, Alex Gibberd</p>
                    <p>  Characterising the interactions between spiking neurons is central to our
understanding of cognitive processes such as memory, perception and decision
making. In this work, we consider the problem of inferring connectivity in the
brain network from non-stationary high-dimensional spike train data. Under a
binned spike count representation of these data, we propose a Bernoulli
autoregressive partially linear additive (BAPLA) model to identify the
effective connectivity of a population of neurons. Estimates of the model
parameters are obtained using a regularised maximum likelihood estimator, where
an $\ell_1$ penalty is used to find sparse and interpretable estimates of
neuronal interactions. We also account for non-stationary firing rates by
adding a non-parametric trend to the model and provide an inference procedure
to quantify the uncertainty associated with our estimated networks of neuronal
interactions. We use synthetic data to assess the performance of the BAPLA
method, highlighting its ability to detect both excitatory and inhibitory
interactions in various settings. Finally, we apply our method to a neural
spiking dataset from the DANDI archive, where we study the interactions of
neural processes in reaction to various stimulus-response type neuroscience
experiments.

                    <h3>Regression approaches for modelling genotype-environment interaction and
  making predictions into unseen environments</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maksym Hrachov, Hans-Peter Piepho, Niaz Md. Farhat Rahman, Waqas Ahmed Malik</p>
                    <p>  In plant breeding and variety testing, there is an increasing interest in
making use of environmental information to enhance predictions for new
environments. Here, we will review linear mixed models that have been proposed
for this purpose. The emphasis will be on predictions and on methods to assess
the uncertainty of predictions for new environments. Our point of departure is
straight-line regression, which may be extended to multiple environmental
covariates and genotype-specific responses. When observable environmental
covariates are used, this is also known as factorial regression. Early work
along these lines can be traced back to Stringfield & Salter (1934) and Yates &
Cochran (1938), who proposed a method nowadays best known as Finlay-Wilkinson
regression. This method, in turn, has close ties with regression on latent
environmental covariates and factor-analytic variance-covariance structures for
genotype-environment interaction. Extensions of these approaches - reduced rank
regression, kernel- or kinship-based approaches, random coefficient regression,
and extended Finlay-Wilkinson regression - will be the focus of this paper. Our
objective is to demonstrate how seemingly disparate methods are very closely
linked and fall within a common model-based prediction framework. The framework
considers environments as random throughout, with genotypes also modelled as
random in most cases. We will discuss options for assessing uncertainty of
predictions, including cross validation and model-based estimates of
uncertainty. The methods are illustrated using a long-term rice variety trial
dataset from Bangladesh.

                    <h3>A Two-armed Bandit Framework for A/B Testing</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinjuan Wang, Qianglin Wen, Yu Zhang, Xiaodong Yan, Chengchun Shi</p>
                    <p>  A/B testing is widely used in modern technology companies for policy
evaluation and product deployment, with the goal of comparing the outcomes
under a newly-developed policy against a standard control. Various causal
inference and reinforcement learning methods developed in the literature are
applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework
designed to improve the power of existing approaches. The proposed procedure
consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to
generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to
construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to
compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
through asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a
ridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing
methods.
