                    <h3>Comparing Methods of Expert Elicitation for Treatment Effect or
  Borrowing Parameters in Standard and Rare Disease Clinical Trials: A
  Systematic Mapping Study</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura M. Morgan, James M. S. Wason, Kevin J. Wilson, Nina Wilson</p>
                    <p>  Expert elicitation is an invaluable tool for gaining insights into the degree
of clinical knowledge surrounding parameters of interest when designing, or
supplementing trial data when analysing, a clinical trial. Elicitation is
considered particularly useful in cases where limited data are available, such
as in rare diseases. This study aims to identify methods of expert elicitation
and aggregation for treatment effect or borrowing parameters that are used in
the design or analysis stages of clinical trials. A comprehensive review of
statistical and non-statistical literature was conducted by database searching,
and reference list screening of older, relevant literature reviews. The search
took place in October 2024 and identified 366 potentially relevant
publications. Of these, 126 were selected for full-text review based on review
of titles and abstracts, and 41 publications were deemed eligible for inclusion
after a full reading. For each included publication, data were extracted on
methods of elicitation and aggregation, the types of parameters elicited, the
resulting distributions, the number of experts used, and any training provided
to experts. Publication characteristics such as contribution type, journal
type, and application to the rare disease setting was also noted. A narrative
description of the selected publications was produced, detailing 6 unique
methods for expert elicitation and 10 unique methods for aggregation. We
discuss the most popular methods used across standard and rare disease clinical
trials, along with any strengths and limitations. Overall, there is no formal
framework for expert elicitation in clinical trials, and more general methods
are applied with little consideration into the specific context and trial
designs. This review identifies the methodological gaps in current practice,
providing a foundation for future development.

                    <h3>A Time Series Model for Three Asset Classes used in Financial Simulator</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Sarantsev, Angel Piotrowski, Ian Anderson</p>
                    <p>  We create a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for annual returns
of three asset classes: the USA Standard & Poor (S&P) stock index, the
international stock index, and the USA Bank of America investment-grade
corporate bond index. Using this, we made an online financial app simulating
wealth process. This includes options for regular withdrawals and
contributions. Four factors are: S&P volatility and earnings, corporate BAA
rate, and long-short Treasury bond spread. Our valuation measure is an
improvement of Shiller's cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio. We use
classic linear regression models, and make residuals white noise by dividing by
annual volatility. We use multivariate kernel density estimation for residuals.
We state and prove long-term stability results.

                    <h3>Bayesian weighted discrete-time dynamic models for association football
  prediction</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roberto Macr√¨-Demartino, Leonardo Egidi, Nicola Torelli</p>
                    <p>  In recent years, great emphasis has been placed on the prediction of
association football. Due to this, several studies have proposed different
types of statistical models to predict the outcome of a football match.
However, most existing approaches usually assume that the offensive and
defensive abilities of teams remain static over time. We introduce a Bayesian
dynamic approach for football goal based models that uses period-specific
commensurate priors to flexibly weight the evolution of attacking and defensive
abilities. Our approach assigns separate, time varying precisions for each
ability and period, controlled via spike and slab hyperpriors. This adaptive
shrinkage borrows information about teams' strength when past and current
performance aligns and allows rapid adjustments when teams experience
substantial changes (e.g., transfer windows or coaching changes). We integrate
this framework into six standard goal based models evaluating predictive
performance using data from the last five seasons of the German Bundesliga,
English Premier League, and Spanish La Liga. Compared with the other discrete
time dynamic models, our adaptive approach yields better predictive
performance. The proposed methodology has also been implemented in the free and
open source R package footBayes.

                    <h3>SkipTrack: A Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Self-tracked Menstrual
  Cycle Length and Regularity in Large Mobile Health Cohorts</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Duttweiler, Gowtham Asokan, Zifan Wang, Shruthi Mahalingaiah, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Russ Hauser, Michelle A. Williams, Kayley Abrams, Christine L. Curry, Brent A. Coull</p>
                    <p>  Menstrual cycle length and regularity are important vital signs with
implications for a variety of acute and chronic health conditions. Large
datasets derived from cycle-tracking mobile health apps are being used to
investigate the effects of various covariates on menstrual cycle length and
regularity. One limitation on these analyses is that recorded cycle lengths can
be incorrectly inflated if users skip tracking any cycle related bleeding days
in the app. Here we present SkipTrack, a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework
for examining baseline and time-varying effects on menstrual cycle length and
regularity while accounting for the uncertainty of possible skips in cycle
tracking. In simulations we demonstrate the superiority of the SkipTrack model
by showing that competing methods which specify cycle skips a priori are more
susceptible to issues of estimation bias and overconfidence than the SkipTrack
model. Finally, we apply the SkipTrack framework to data from the Apple Women's
Healthy Study, a US-based digital cohort (consent provided at study enrollment)
to examine patterns of association between age, BMI and race/ethnicity, and
menstrual cycle length and regularity.

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xichen Sun, Xingzhi Jia, Rogelio Oliva</p>
                    <p>  Although goal-setting theory predicts that a challenging and specific goal
can improve performance, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of an
environmental goal in organizations is mixed. Using a panel data set consisting
over 700 global firms across multiple industries, we apply a
Difference-in-Differences (DiD) strategy and empirically analyze the effect of
having science-based carbon emissions targets (SBTs) on firms' carbon
performance. The findings in this study contribute to the debate regarding the
necessity of setting SBTs.

                    <h3>Estimated Phase II Weibull control chart for monitoring times between
  events</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanuja Negi</p>
                    <p>  In statistical process control Weibull distribution can be used to model the
time between events or failures (TBE) in a process with increasing decreasing
or constant failure rates. Specifically it helps in monitoring processes where
the time between defect occurrences is of interest providing insight into the
process reliability and performance. In this paper we consider the two sided
problem of monitoring either an increase or a decrease in the scale parameter
of the Weibull distribution with control charts assuming the shape parameter to
be fixed. A larger scale parameter indicates that events are more spread out
over time suggesting fewer defects while a smaller value may suggest
deterioration in the process resulting in a higher number of defects. When the
scale parameter is unknown it is estimated from Phase I observations and the
plug in control limits are obtained by replacing the parameter by its estimated
value from the Phase I observations. Given the well accepted fact that
estimated control limits often do not perform as expected, the control limits
of the Weibull chart are adjusted to achieve the desired in control (IC)
performance using two criteria that are conditional average run length and
standard deviation of conditional ARL. A performance study is carried out in
order to assess in control and out of control performances of the proposed
charts.

                    <h3>Modeling Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Obesity in Italian Regions Via
  Bayesian Beta Regression</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luciano Rota, Raffaele Argiento, Michela Cameletti</p>
                    <p>  In this paper we investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of obesity rates
across Italian regions from 2010 to 2022, aiming to identify spatial and
temporal trends and assess potential heterogeneities. We implement a Bayesian
hierarchical Beta regression model to analyze regional obesity rates,
integrating spatial and temporal random effects, alongside gender and various
exogenous predictors. The model leverages the Stochastic Search Variable
Selection technique to identify significant predictors supported by the data.
The analysis reveals both regional heterogeneity and dependence in obesity
rates over the study period, emphasizing the importance of considering gender
and spatial correlation in explaining its dynamics over time. In fact, the
inclusion of structured spatial and temporal random effects captures the
complexities of regional variations over time. These random effects, along with
gender, emerge as the primary determinants of obesity prevalence across Italian
regions, while the role of exogenous covariates is found to be minimal at the
regional level. While socioeconomic and lifestyle factors remain fundamental at
a micro-level, the findings demonstrate that the integration of spatial and
temporal structures is critical for capturing macro-level obesity variations.

                    <h3>Plans for acceptance sampling by attributes when observations are
  destructive</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugalf Bernburg, Katy Klauenberg</p>
                    <p>  The international standard ISO 2859-2 provides plans for acceptance sampling
by attributes, that ensure a defined quality level in isolated lots using the
hypergeometric distribution. In destructive testing, the sample itself is
damaged or changed such that the quality of an entire lot is less relevant than
the quality of the lot that remains after removing the sample. Examples include
assessing the germination of seeds and the conformity of in-service utility
meters.
  This research highlights that the hypergeometric distribution cannot describe
the frequentist consumer's risk of accepting a remaining lot with
unsatisfactory quality. Consequently, sampling plans as those provided in ISO
2859-2 are ill-suited to assess the remaining lot when sampling destructively.
In contrast, Bayesian statistics inherently infers the lot's quality after
sampling. Using a reference prior, we show that sampling plans provided by ISO
2859-2 result in high specific consumer's risk for small remaining lots.
  The ISO 2859-2 being ill-suited, we design plans for destructive sampling
that limit the (Bayesian) specific consumer's risk. To tabulate these plans in
a similar way to ISO 2859-2, we propose a new representation that fixes the
remaining lot size $N-n$ rather than the sample size $n$. This generalizable,
concise and efficient representation is suitable for future standardization of
destructive sampling.

                    <h3>Introducing Powerwise (PWR): A pairwise and Power Rating method for
  selecting at-large teams to the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lawrence Feldman, Matthew Bomparola</p>
                    <p>  This document describes a new system for selecting teams for the NCAA Men's
Division I Lacrosse championship tournament called "Powerwise" that was
developed in discussions with the NCAA Lacrosse Selection Criteria and Ranking
Committee (SCR). The method is simple, employing hierarchical pairwise
comparisons that emphasize on-field performance in head-to-head and common
opponent matchups, and a simple Massey/Colley/Sagarin-like statistic called the
Power Rating (PR) when on-field results are not conclusive. Power Ratings are
based on margin of victory and implicitly account for strength of schedule.
Powerwise addresses the complexities of team selection in a way that both
coaches and fans can understand while improving the fairness, objectivity, and
overall quality of the selection process.

                    <h3>Federal Reserve Communication and the COVID-19 Pandemic</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Benchimol, Sophia Kazinnik, Yossi Saadon</p>
                    <p>  In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies
during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous
periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to
COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,
combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a
distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,
market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual
uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication
during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global
financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our
findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to
the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment
related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes
anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further
document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's
Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the
Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in
communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings
contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves
during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic
circumstances.
