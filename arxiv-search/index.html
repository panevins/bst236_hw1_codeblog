                    <h3>Estimating the Effects of Heatwaves on Health: A Causal Inference Framework</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulio Grossi, Leo Vanciu, Veronica Ballerini, Danielle Braun, Falco J. Bargagli Stoffi</p>
                    <p>The harmful relationship between heatwaves and health has been extensively documented in medical and epidemiological literature. However, most evidence is associational and cannot be interpreted causally unless strong assumptions are made. In this paper, we first make explicit the assumptions underlying the statistical methods frequently used in the heatwave literature and demonstrate when these assumptions might break down in heatwave contexts. To address these shortcomings, we propose a causal inference framework that transparently elicits causal identification assumptions. Within this new framework, we first introduce synthetic controls (SC) for estimating heatwave effects, then propose a spatially augmented Bayesian synthetic control (SA-SC) method that accounts for spatial dependence and spillovers. Empirical Monte Carlo simulations show both methods perform well, with SA-SC reducing root mean squared error and improving posterior interval coverage under spillovers and spatial dependence. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to estimate the causal effects of heatwaves on Medicare heat-related hospitalizations among 13,753,273 beneficiaries residing in Northeastern U.S. from 2000 to 2019. This causal inference framework provides spatially coherent counterfactual outcomes and robust, interpretable, and transparent causal estimates while explicitly addressing the unexamined assumptions in existing methods that pervade the heatwave effect literature.</p>

                    <h3>Multivariate longitudinal modeling of cross-sectional and lagged associations between a continuous time-varying endogenous covariate and a non-Gaussian outcome</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chiara Degan, Bart J. A. Mertens, Jelle Goeman, Nadine A. Ikelaar, Erik H. Niks, Pietro Spitali, Roula Tsonaka</p>
                    <p>In longitudinal studies, time-varying covariates are often endogenous, meaning their values depend on both their own history and that of the outcome variable. This violates key assumptions of Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models (GLMMs), leading to biased and inconsistent estimates. Additionally, missing data and non-concurrent measurements between covariates and outcomes further complicate analysis, especially in rare or degenerative diseases where data is limited. To address these challenges, we propose an alternative use of two well-known multivariate models, each assuming a different form of the association. One induces the association by jointly modeling the random effects, called Joint Mixed Model (JMM); the other quantifies the association using a scaling factor, called Joint Scaled Model (JSM). We extend these models to accommodate continuous endogenous covariates and a wide range of longitudinal outcome types. A limitation in both cases is that the interpretation of the association is neither straightforward nor easy to communicate to scientists. Hence, we have numerically derived an association coefficient that measures the marginal relation between the outcome and the endogenous covariate. The proposed method provides interpretable, population-level estimates of cross-sectional associations (capturing relationships between covariates and outcomes measured at the same time point) and lagged associations (quantifying how past covariate values influence future outcomes), enabling clearer clinical insights. We fitted the JMM and JSM using a flexible Bayesian estimation approach, known as Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), to overcome computation burden problems. These models will be presented along with the results of a simulation study and a natural history study on patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.</p>

                    <h3>Modeling U.S. Mortality and Suicide Rates by Integrating Mental Health and Socio-Economic Indicators</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brianne Weaver, Brigg Trendler, Chris Groendyke, Brian Hartman, Robert Richardson, Davey Erekson</p>
                    <p>Accurate mortality modeling is central to actuarial science and public health, especially as mental health emerges as a significant factor in population outcomes. This paper develops and applies a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze U.S. county-level mortality and suicide rates from 2010 to 2023. Applying a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure to each combination of sex and age grouping, the model captures spatial and temporal trends while incorporating mental health surveillance data and socio-economic indicators. We first assess socio-economic covariates in predicting suicide. While the results vary considerably by age and sex, we find that the county-wide levels of educational attainment, housing prices, marriage rates, racial composition, household size, and poor mental health days all have significant relationships with suicide rates. We next consider the impact of various mental health indicators on all-cause and suicide-specific mortality and find that the strongest effects are observed in younger populations. The spatial and temporal correlation structures reveal substantial regional clustering and time-consistent trends in both all-cause mortality and suicide rates, supporting the use of spatio-temporal methods. Our findings highlight the value of integrating mental health surveillance data into mortality models to better identify emerging risk areas and vulnerable populations. This approach has the potential to inform public health policy, resource allocation, and targeted interventions aimed at reducing disparities in mortality and suicide across U.S. communities.</p>

                    <h3>Two Americas of Well-Being: Divergent Rural-Urban Patterns of Life Satisfaction and Happiness from 2.6 B Social Media Posts</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Maria Iacus, Giuseppe Porro</p>
                    <p>Using 2.6 billion geolocated social-media posts (2014-2022) and a fine-tuned generative language model, we construct county-level indicators of life satisfaction and happiness for the United States. We document an apparent rural-urban paradox: rural counties express higher life satisfaction while urban counties exhibit greater happiness. We reconcile this by treating the two as distinct layers of subjective well-being, evaluative vs. hedonic, showing that each maps differently onto place, politics, and time. Republican-leaning areas appear more satisfied in evaluative terms, but partisan gaps in happiness largely flatten outside major metros, indicating context-dependent political effects. Temporal shocks dominate the hedonic layer: happiness falls sharply during 2020-2022, whereas life satisfaction moves more modestly. These patterns are robust across logistic and OLS specifications and align with well-being theory. Interpreted as associations for the population of social-media posts, the results show that large-scale, language-based indicators can resolve conflicting findings about the rural-urban divide by distinguishing the type of well-being expressed, offering a transparent, reproducible complement to traditional surveys.</p>

                    <h3>Estimating the true number of principal components under the random design</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasuyuki Matsumura</p>
                    <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is frequently employed as a dimension reduction tool when the number of covariates is large. However, the number of principal components to be retained in PCA is typically determined in a researcher-dependent manner. To mitigate the subjectivity in PCA, this paper proposes a data-driven testing procedure to estimate the number of underlying principal components. While existing work such as G'Sell et al. (2016), Taylor et al. (2016) and Choi et al. (2017) discuss similar tests under fixed design, this paper investigates an extension of their framework to a more general econometric setup with the random design. The proposed test is proved to achieve asymptotically exact type 1 error controls under a locally defined null hypothesis, with simulation examples indicating an asymptotic validity of our test.</p>

                    <h3>Heuristic Solutions for the Best Secretary Problem</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugene Seong</p>
                    <p>This paper introduces a heuristic framework for the Best Secretary Problem, where one item must be selected using rank information only. We develop five data-responsive rules extending classical fixed-cutoff methods: an expected-record threshold, an adaptive deviation correction, a probabilistic early-accept rule, a two-phase relaxation, and a local dynamic programming approximation. These rules adjust thresholds sequentially as information accumulates. Simulations across diverse sample sizes, distributions, and autocorrelated settings show that the heuristics match or exceed traditional optimal rules in stability and efficiency. The expected-record rule remains strong despite its simplicity, the adaptive correction performs well under asymmetry, and the adaptive and probabilistic rules reduce average stopping times. An ensemble combining multiple rules yields the most stable performance. Overall, a few intuitive parameters achieve near-optimal results, demonstrating that data-responsive heuristics can effectively extend rank-based optimal stopping to dynamic decision environments.</p>

                    <h3>A tutorial for propensity score weighting methods under violations of the positivity assumption</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Liu, Yuan Wang, Ying Gao, Tonia Poteat, Roland A. Matsouaka</p>
                    <p>Violations of the positivity assumption can render conventional causal estimands unidentifiable, including the average treatment effect (ATE), the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), and the average treatment effect on the controls (ATC). Shifting the inferential focus to their alternative counterparts -- the weighted ATE (WATE), the weighted ATT (WATT), and the weighted ATC (WATC) -- offers valuable insights into treatment effects while preserving internal validity. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in propensity score (PS) weighting methods, along with practical guidance on how to select a primary target estimand (while other estimands serve as supplementary analyses), implement the corresponding PS-weighted estimators, and conduct post-weighting diagnostic assessments. The tutorial is accompanied by a user-friendly R package, ChiPS. We demonstrate the pertinence of various estimators through extensive simulation studies. We illustrate the flow of the tutorial on two real-world case studies: (i) Effect of smoking on blood lead level using data from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); and (ii) Impact of history of sex work on HIV status among transgender women in South Africa.</p>

                    <h3>A Clustering Approach for Basket Trials Based on Treatment Response Trajectories</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Kojima, Keisuke Hanada, Atsuya Sato</p>
                    <p>Heterogeneity in efficacy is sometimes observed across baskets in basket trials. In this study, we propose a model-free clustering framework that groups baskets based on transition probabilities derived from the trajectories of treatment response, rather than relying solely on a single efficacy endpoint such as the objective response rate. The number of clusters is not predetermined but is automatically determined in a data-driven manner based on the similarity structure among baskets. After clustering, baskets within the same cluster are analyzed using a hierarchical Bayesian model. This framework aims to improve the estimation precision of efficacy endpoints and enhance statistical power while maintaining the type~I error rate at the nominal level. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through simulation studies. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately identify cluster structures in heterogeneous settings and, even under such conditions, maintain the type~I error rate at the nominal level while improving statistical power.</p>

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro V. M. Oliveira</p>
                    <p>This paper presents and discusses forms of estimation by regularized regression and model selection using the LASSO method - Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. LASSO is recognized as one of the main supervised learning methods applied to high-dimensional econometrics, allowing work with large volumes of data and multiple correlated controls. Conceptual issues related to the consequences of high dimensionality in modern econometrics and the principle of sparsity, which underpins regularization procedures, are addressed. The study examines the main post-double selection and post-regularization models, including variations applied to instrumental variable models. A brief description of the lassopack routine package, its syntaxes, and examples of HD, HDS (High-Dimension Sparse), and IV-HDS models, with combinations involving fixed effects estimators, is also presented. Finally, the potential application of the approach in research focused on air transport is discussed, with emphasis on an empirical study on the operational efficiency of airlines and aircraft fuel consumption.</p>

                    <h3>Masked Mineral Modeling: Continent-Scale Mineral Prospecting via Geospatial Infilling</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujay Nair, Evan Coleman, Sherrie Wang, Elsa Olivetti</p>
                    <p>Minerals play a critical role in the advanced energy technologies necessary for decarbonization, but characterizing mineral deposits hidden underground remains costly and challenging. Inspired by recent progress in generative modeling, we develop a learning method which infers the locations of minerals by masking and infilling geospatial maps of resource availability. We demonstrate this technique using mineral data for the conterminous United States, and train performant models, with the best achieving Dice coefficients of $0.31 \pm 0.01$ and recalls of $0.22 \pm 0.02$ on test data at 1$\times$1 mi$^2$ spatial resolution. One major advantage of our approach is that it can easily incorporate auxiliary data sources for prediction which may be more abundant than mineral data. We highlight the capabilities of our model by adding input layers derived from geophysical sources, along with a nation-wide ground survey of soils originally intended for agronomic purposes. We find that employing such auxiliary features can improve inference performance, while also enabling model evaluation in regions with no recorded minerals.</p>
