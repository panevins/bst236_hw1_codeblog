                    <h3>Numerical Simulation Informed Rapid Cure Process Optimization of
  Composite Structures using Constrained Bayesian Optimization</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhura Limaye, Yezhuo Li, Qiong Zhang, Gang Li</p>
                    <p>  The present study aimed to solve the cure optimization problem of laminated
composites through a statistical approach. The approach consisted of using
constrained Bayesian Optimization (cBO) along with a Gaussian process model as
a surrogate to rapidly solve the cure optimization problem. The approach was
implemented to two case studies including the cure of a simpler flat
rectangular laminate and a more complex L-shaped laminate. The cure
optimization problem with the objective to minimize cure induced distortion was
defined for both case studies. The former case study was two-variable that is
used two cure cycle parameters as design variables and was constrained to
achieve full cure, while the latter was four-variable and had to satisfy
constraints of full cure as well as other cure cycle parameters. The
performance of cBO for both case studies was compared to the traditional
optimization approach based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). The comparison of
results from GA and cBO including deformation and final degree of cure showed
significant agreement (error < 4%). The computational efficiency of cBO was
calculated by comparing the convergence steps for GA (>1000) and cBO (<50). The
computational efficiency of cBO for all optimization cases was found to be >
96%. The case studies conclude that cBO is promising in terms of computational
time and accuracy for solving the cure optimization problem.

                    <h3>Supporting product launching decisions with adversarial risk analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo G. Arce, Sonali Das, David RÃ­os Insua</p>
                    <p>  In a world of utility-driven marketing, each company acts as an adversary to
other contenders, with all having competing interests. A major challenge for
companies launching a new product is that, despite testing, flaws in their
product can remain, potentially risking a loss in market share. However,
delayed launch decisions can lead to losing first-mover advantages.
Furthermore, each company generally has incomplete information on the launch
strategy and the product quality of competing brands. From a buyer's
perspective, along with the price, customers need to make their buying
decisions based on noisy signals, e.g.\ regarding the quality of competing
brands. This paper proposes how to support product launch decisions by a
company in the presence of several competitors and multiple buyers, with the
aid of adversarial risk analysis methods. We illustrate applications in two
software launch cases that require deciding about timing, pricing, and quality,
referring to single and multiple product purchases.

  validating new drug indications</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nabasmita Talukdar, Xiaodan Zhang, Shreya Paithankar, Hui Wang, Bin Chen</p>
                    <p>  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been increasingly used as real-world
evidence (RWE) to support the discovery and validation of new drug indications.
This paper surveys current approaches to EHR-based drug repurposing, covering
data sources, processing methodologies, and representation techniques. It
discusses study designs and statistical frameworks for evaluating drug
efficacy. Key challenges in validation are discussed, with emphasis on the role
of large language models (LLMs) and target trial emulation. By synthesizing
recent developments and methodological advances, this work provides a
foundational resource for researchers aiming to translate real-world data into
actionable drug-repurposing evidence.

                    <h3>Bayesian nonparametric clustering for spatio-temporal data, with an
  application to air pollution</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Aiello, Raffaele Argiento, Sirio Legramanti, Lucia Paci</p>
                    <p>  Air pollution is a major global health hazard, with fine particulate matter
(PM10) linked to severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Hence,
analyzing and clustering spatio-temporal air quality data is crucial for
understanding pollution dynamics and guiding policy interventions. This work
provides a review of Bayesian nonparametric clustering methods, with a
particular focus on their application to spatio-temporal data, which are
ubiquitous in environmental sciences. We first introduce key modeling
approaches for point-referenced spatio-temporal data, highlighting their
flexibility in capturing complex spatial and temporal dependencies. We then
review recent advancements in Bayesian clustering, focusing on spatial product
partition models, which incorporate spatial structure into the clustering
process. We illustrate the proposed methods on PM10 monitoring data from
Northern Italy, demonstrating their ability to identify meaningful pollution
patterns. This review highlights the potential of Bayesian nonparametric
methods for environmental risk assessment and offers insights into future
research directions in spatio-temporal clustering for public health and
environmental science.

                    <h3>Two-stage MCMC for Fast Bayesian Inference of Large Spatio-temporal
  Ordinal Data, with Application to US Drought</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Staci Hepler, Rob Erhardt</p>
                    <p>  High dimensional space-time data pose known computational challenges when
fitting spatio-temporal models. Such data show dependence across several
dimensions of space as well as in time, and can easily involve hundreds of
thousands of observations. Many spatio-temporal models result in a dependence
structure across all observations and can be fit only at a substantial
computational cost, arising from dense matrix inversion, high dimensional
parameter spaces, poor mixing in Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or the impossibility
of utilizing parallel computing due to a lack of independence anywhere in the
model fitting process. These computational challenges are exacerbated when the
response variable is ordinal, and especially as the number of ordered
categories grows. Some spatio-temporal models achieve computational feasibility
for large datasets but only through overly restrictive model simplifications,
which we seek to avoid here. In this paper we demonstrate a two-stage algorithm
to fit a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to large datasets when the response
variable is ordinal. The first stage models locations independently in space,
capturing temporal dependence, and can be run in parallel. The second stage
resamples from the first stage posterior distributions with an acceptance
probability computed to impose spatial dependence from the full spatio-temporal
model. The result is fast Bayesian inference which samples from the full
spatio-temporal posterior and is computationally feasible even for large
datasets. We quantify the substantial computational gains our approach
achieves, and demonstrate the preservation of the posterior distribution as
compared to the more costly single-stage model fit. We apply our approach to a
large spatio-temporal drought dataset in the United States, a dataset too large
for many existing spatio-temporal methods.

                    <h3>Enhancing the Accuracy of Spatio-Temporal Models for Wind Speed
  Prediction by Incorporating Bias-Corrected Crowdsourced Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eamonn Organ, Maeve Upton, Denis Allard, Lionel Benoit, James Sweeney</p>
                    <p>  Accurate high-resolution spatial and temporal wind speed data is critical for
estimating the wind energy potential of a location. For real-time wind speed
prediction, statistical models typically depend on high-quality (near)
real-time data from official meteorological stations to improve forecasting
accuracy. Personal weather stations (PWS) offer an additional source of
real-time data and broader spatial coverage than offical stations. However,
they are not subject to rigorous quality control and may exhibit bias or
measurement errors. This paper presents a framework for incorporating PWS data
into statistical models for validated official meteorological station data via
a two-stage approach. First, bias correction is performed on PWS wind speed
data using reanalysis data. Second, we implement a Bayesian hierarchical
spatio-temporal model that accounts for varying measurement error in the PWS
data. This enables wind speed prediction across a target area, and is
particularly beneficial for improving predictions in regions sparse in official
monitoring stations. Our results show that including bias-corrected PWS data
improves prediction accuracy compared to using meteorological station data
alone, with a 7% reduction in prediction error on average across all sites. The
results are comparable with popular reanalysis products, but unlike these
numerical weather models our approach is available in real-time and offers
improved uncertainty quantification.

                    <h3>Inhomogeneous mark correlation functions for general marked point
  processes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Moradi, Matthias Eckardt</p>
                    <p>  Spatial phenomena in environmental and biological contexts often involve
events that are unevenly distributed across space and carry attributes, whose
associations/variations are space-dependent. In this paper, we introduce the
class of inhomogeneous mark correlation functions, capturing mark
associations/variations, while explicitly accounting for the spatial
inhomogeneity of events. The proposed functions are designed to quantify how,
on average, marks vary or associate with one another as a function of pairwise
spatial distances. We develop nonparametric estimators and evaluate their
performance through simulation studies covering a range of scenarios with mark
association or variation, spanning from nonstationary point patterns without
spatial interaction to those characterised by clustering tendencies. Our
simulations reveal the shortcomings of traditional methods in the presence of
spatial inhomogeneity, underscoring the necessity of our approach. Furthermore,
the results show that our estimators accurately identify both the
positivity/negativity and effective spatial range for detected mark
associations/variations. The proposed inhomogeneous mark correlation functions
are then applied to two distinct forest ecosystems: Longleaf pine trees in
southern Georgia, USA, marked by their diameter at breast height, and Scots
pine trees in Pfynwald, Switzerland, marked by their height. Our findings
reveal that the inhomogeneous mark correlation functions provide deeper and
more detailed insights into tree growth patterns compared to traditional
methods

                    <h3>Joint space-time modelling for upper daily maximum and minimum
  temperature record-breaking</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Castillo-Mateo, Zeus Gracia-Tabuenca, JesÃºs AsÃ­n, Ana C. CebriÃ¡n, Alan E. Gelfand</p>
                    <p>  Record-breaking temperature events are now frequently in the news, proffered
as evidence of climate change, and often bring significant economic and human
impacts. Our previous work undertook the first substantial spatial modelling
investigation of temperature record-breaking across years for any given day
within the year, employing a dataset consisting of over sixty years of daily
maximum temperatures across peninsular Spain. That dataset also supplies daily
minimum temperatures (which, in fact, are now available through 2023). Here,
the dataset is converted into a daily pair of binary events, indicators, for
that day, of whether a yearly record was broken for the daily maximum
temperature and/or for the daily minimum temperature. Joint modelling addresses
several inference issues: (i) defining/modelling record-breaking with bivariate
time series of yearly indicators, (ii) strength of relationship between
record-breaking events, (iii) prediction of joint, conditional and marginal
record-breaking, (iv) persistence in record-breaking across days, (v) spatial
interpolation across peninsular Spain. We substantially expand our previous
work to enable investigation of these issues. We observe strong correlation
between both processes but a growing trend of climate change that is well
differentiated between them both spatially and temporally as well as different
strengths of persistence and spatial dependence.

                    <h3>A Time-Scaled ETAS Model for Earthquake Forecasting</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agniva Das, Muralidharan K</p>
                    <p>  The Himalayan region, particularly Nepal, is highly susceptible to frequent
and severe seismic activity, underscoring the urgent need for robust earthquake
forecasting models. This study introduces a suite of time-scaled Epidemic-Type
Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) models tailored for earthquake forecasting in Nepal,
leveraging seismic data from 2000 to 2020. By incorporating alternative
time-scaling approaches - such as calibration, proportional hazards,
log-linear, and power time scales - the models capture nuanced temporal
patterns of aftershocks, improving event classification between background and
triggered occurrences. We evaluate model performance under various assumptions
of earthquake magnitude distributions (exponential, gamma, and radially
symmetric) and employ optimization techniques including the
Davidon-Fletcher-Powell algorithm and Iterative Stochastic De-clustering. The
results reveal that time-scaling significantly enhances model interpretability
and predictive accuracy, with the ISDM-based ETAS model achieving the best fit.
This work not only deepens the statistical understanding of earthquake dynamics
in Nepal but also lays a foundation for implementing more effective early
warning systems in seismically active regions.

                    <h3>Bayesian Inference for Spatially-Temporally Misaligned Data Using
  Predictive Stacking</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumyakanti Pan, Sudipto Banerjee</p>
                    <p>  Air pollution remains a major environmental risk factor that is often
associated with adverse health outcomes. However, quantifying and evaluating
its effects on human health is challenging due to the complex nature of
exposure data. Recent technological advances have led to the collection of
various indicators of air pollution at increasingly high spatial-temporal
resolutions (e.g., daily averages of pollutant levels at spatial locations
referenced by latitude-longitude). However, health outcomes are typically
aggregated over several spatial-temporal coordinates (e.g., annual prevalence
for a county) to comply with survey regulations. This article develops a
Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze such spatially-temporally misaligned
exposure and health outcome data. We introduce Bayesian predictive stacking,
which optimally combines multiple predictive spatial-temporal models and avoids
iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo that struggle
due to convergence issues inflicted by the presence of weakly identified
parameters. We apply our proposed method to study the effects of ozone on
asthma in the state of California.
