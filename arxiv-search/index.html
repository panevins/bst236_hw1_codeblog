                    <h2>Estimated Roadway Segment Traffic Data by Vehicle Class for the United
  States: A Machine Learning Approach</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brittany Antonczak, Meg Fay, Aviral Chawla, Gregory Rowangould</p>
                    <p>  The Highway Performance Monitoring System, managed by the Federal Highway
Administration, provides essential data on average annual daily traffic across
U.S. roadways, but it has limited representation of medium- and heavy-duty
vehicles on non-interstate roads. This gap limits research and policy analysis
on the impacts of truck traffic, especially concerning air quality and public
health. To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium-
and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results
in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic
density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution
exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated,
provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental
and health impacts. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning,
public health research, and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the effects of
truck traffic on vulnerable communities exposed to air pollution.

                    <h2>Joint TITE-CRM for Dual Agent Dose Finding Studies</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Helen Barnett, Oliver Boix, Dimitris Kontos, Thomas Jaki</p>
                    <p>  Dual agent dose-finding trials study the effect of a combination of more than
one agent, where the objective is to find the Maximum Tolerated Dose
Combination (MTC), the combination of doses of the two agents that is
associated with a pre-specified risk of being unsafe. In a Phase I/II setting,
the objective is to find a dose combination that is both safe and active, the
Optimal Biological Dose (OBD), that optimizes a criterion based on both safety
and activity. Since Oncology treatments are typically given over multiple
cycles, both the safety and activity outcome can be considered as late-onset,
potentially occurring in the later cycles of treatment. This work proposes two
model-based designs for dual-agent dose finding studies with late-onset
activity and late-onset toxicity outcomes, the Joint TITE-POCRM and the Joint
TITE-BLRM. Their performance is compared alongside a model-assisted comparator
in a comprehensive simulation study motivated by a real trial example, with an
extension to consider alternative sized dosing grids. It is found that both
model-based methods outperform the model-assisted design. Whilst on average the
two model-based designs are comparable, this comparability is not consistent
across scenarios.

                    <h2>Invariant Image Reparameterisation: A Unified Approach to Structural and
  Practical Identifiability and Model Reduction</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver J. Maclaren, Ruanui Nicholson, Joel A. Trent, Joshua Rottenberry, Matthew Simpson</p>
                    <p>  Both structural and practical parameter non-identifiability present
fundamental challenges when using mathematical models to interpret data. This
issue is particularly acute in complex, applied areas such as the life sciences
or engineering, where determining appropriate model complexity is challenging.
While several approaches exist for diagnosing and resolving parameter
non-identifiability, including symbolic methods, profile likelihood analysis,
and sloppiness analysis, these approaches have distinct limitations and are
rarely combined. We present an integrated approach called Invariant Image
Reparameterisation (IIR) that incorporates key elements of these methods in a
new way. Our approach replaces symbolic computations with numerical
calculations at a single reference estimate and an invariance condition that
determines when this local calculation holds globally. Parameter combinations
determined by this method are naturally ordered by degree of identifiability,
and this supports model reduction by replacing a practically non-identified
model with a structurally non-identified approximate model. This approximate
model can be further parameterised in terms of identified parameters only. By
treating parameter combinations determined by our approach as interest
parameters within our established likelihood-based Profile-Wise Analysis (PWA)
framework, we incorporate uncertainty quantification in terms of likelihood
profiles and confidence sets. We provide a Julia library on GitHub
(https://github.com/omaclaren/reparam) demonstrating our methodology across a
range of mathematical models.

                    <h2>Estimating the duration of RT-PCR positivity for SARS-CoV-2 from doubly
  interval censored data with undetected infections</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Blake, Paul Birrell, A. Sarah Walker, Koen B. Pouwels, Thomas House, Brian D. M. Tom, Theodore Kypraios, Daniela De Angelis</p>
                    <p>  Monitoring the incidence of new infections during a pandemic is critical for
an effective public health response. General population prevalence surveys for
SARS-CoV-2 can provide high-quality data to estimate incidence. However,
estimation relies on understanding the distribution of the duration that
infections remain detectable. This study addresses this need using data from
the Coronavirus Infection Survey (CIS), a long-term, longitudinal, general
population survey conducted in the UK. Analyzing these data presents unique
challenges, such as doubly interval censoring, undetected infections, and false
negatives. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric survival analysis approach,
estimating a discrete-time distribution of durations and integrating prior
information derived from a complementary study. Our methodology is validated
through a simulation study, including its resilience to model misspecification,
and then applied to the CIS dataset. This results in the first estimate of the
full duration distribution in a general population, as well as methodology that
could be transferred to new contexts.

                    <h2>Capturing Extreme Events in Turbulence using an Extreme Variational
  Autoencoder (xVAE)</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Likun Zhang, Kiran Bhaganagar, Christopher K. Wikle</p>
                    <p>  Turbulent flow fields are characterized by extreme events that are
statistically intermittent and carry a significant amount of energy and
physical importance. To emulate these flows, we introduce the extreme
variational Autoencoder (xVAE), which embeds a max-infinitely divisible process
with heavy-tailed distributions into a standard VAE framework, enabling
accurate modeling of extreme events. xVAEs are neural network models that
reduce system dimensionality by learning non-linear latent representations of
data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of xVAE in large-eddy simulation data of
wildland fire plumes, where intense heat release and complex plume-atmosphere
interactions generate extreme turbulence. Comparisons with the commonly used
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes show that xVAE is more robust in
capturing extreme values and provides a powerful uncertainty quantification
framework using variational Bayes. Additionally, xVAE enables analysis of the
so-called copulas of fields to assess risks associated with rare events while
rigorously accounting for uncertainty, such as simultaneous exceedances of high
thresholds across multiple locations. The proposed approach provides a new
direction for studying realistic turbulent flows, such as high-speed
aerodynamics, space propulsion, and atmospheric and oceanic systems that are
characterized by extreme events.

                    <h2>Dark Brain Energy: Toward an Integrative Model of Spontaneous Slow
  Oscillations</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> ZhuQing Gong, XiNian Zuo</p>
                    <p>  Neural oscillations facilitate the functioning of the human brain in spatial
and temporal dimensions at various frequencies. These oscillations feature a
universal frequency architecture that is governed by brain anatomy, ensuring
frequency specificity remains invariant across different measurement
techniques. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodology constrained
functional MRI (fMRI) investigations to a singular frequency range, thereby
neglecting the frequency characteristics inherent in blood oxygen
level-dependent oscillations. With advancements in MRI technology, it has
become feasible to decode intricate brain activities via multi-band frequency
analysis (MBFA). During the past decade, the utilization of MBFA in fMRI
studies has surged, unveiling frequency-dependent characteristics of
spontaneous slow oscillations (SSOs) believed to base dark energy in the brain.
There remains a dearth of conclusive insights and hypotheses pertaining to the
properties and functionalities of SSOs in distinct bands. We surveyed the SSO
MBFA studies during the past 15 years to delineate the attributes of SSOs and
enlighten their correlated functions. We further proposed a model to elucidate
the hierarchical organization of multi-band SSOs by integrating their function,
aimed at bridging theoretical gaps and guiding future MBFA research endeavors.

                    <h2>Hidden assumptions of integer ratio analyses in bioacoustics and music</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannick Jadoul, Tommaso Tufarelli, Chloé Coissac, Marco Gamba, Andrea Ravignani</p>
                    <p>  Rhythm is ubiquitous in human culture and in nature, but hard to capture in
all its complexity. A key dimension of rhythm, integer ratio categories occur
when the relationship between temporal intervals can be expressed as
small-integer ratios. Recent work has found integer ratio categories in most
human musical cultures and some animal species' vocalizations or behavioral
displays. But biological systems are noisy, and empirically measured intervals
rarely form an exact small-integer ratio. Here, we mathematically assess
whether the leading integer ratio analysis method makes valid statistical and
biological assumptions. In particular, we (1) make the temporal properties of
empirical ratios explicit, both in general and for the typical use in the
literature; (2) show how the choice of ratio formula affects the probability
distribution of rhythm ratios and ensuing statistical results; (3) guide the
reader to carefully consider the assumptions and null hypotheses of the
statistical analysis; (4) present a comprehensive methodology to statistically
test integer ratios for any null hypothesis of choice. Our observations have
implications for both past and future research in music cognition and animal
behavior: They suggest how to interpret past findings and provide tools to
choose the correct null hypotheses in future empirical work.

                    <h2>A Pseudo Markov-Chain Model and Time-Elapsed Measures of Mobility from
  Collective Data</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alisha Foster, David A. Meyer, Asif Shakeel</p>
                    <p>  In this paper we develop a pseudo Markov-chain model to understand
time-elapsed flows, over multiple intervals, from time and space aggregated
collective inter-location trip data, given as a time-series. Building on the
model, we develop measures of mobility that parallel those known for individual
mobility data, such as the radius of gyration. We apply these measures to the
NetMob 2024 Data Challenge data, and obtain interesting results that are
consistent with published statistics and commuting patterns in cities. Besides
building a new framework, we foresee applications of this approach to an
improved understanding of human mobility in the context of environmental
changes and sustainable development.

                    <h2>Accurate Estimates of Ultimate 100-Meter Records</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Einmahl, Yi He</p>
                    <p>  We employ the novel theory of heterogeneous extreme value statistics to
accurately estimate the ultimate world records for the 100-m running race, for
men and for women. For this aim we collected data from 1991 through 2023 from
thousands of top athletes, using multiple fast times per athlete. We consider
the left endpoint of the probability distribution of the running times of a top
athlete and define the ultimate world record as the minimum, over all top
athletes, of all these endpoints. For men we estimate the ultimate world record
to be 9.56 seconds. More prudently, employing this heterogeneous extreme value
theory we construct an accurate asymptotic 95% lower confidence bound on the
ultimate world record of 9.49 seconds, still quite close to the present world
record of 9.58. For the women's 100-meter dash our point estimate of the
ultimate world record is 10.34 seconds, somewhat lower than the world record of
10.49. The more prudent 95% lower confidence bound on the women's ultimate
world record is 10.20.

                    <h2>Market-based insurance ratemaking: application to pet insurance</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre-Olivier Goffard, Pierrick Piette, Gareth W. Peters</p>
                    <p>  This paper introduces a method for pricing insurance policies using market
data. The approach is designed for scenarios in which the insurance company
seeks to enter a new market, in our case: pet insurance, lacking historical
data. The methodology involves an iterative two-step process. First, a suitable
parameter is proposed to characterize the underlying risk. Second, the
resulting pure premium is linked to the observed commercial premium using an
isotonic regression model. To validate the method, comprehensive testing is
conducted on synthetic data, followed by its application to a dataset of actual
pet insurance rates. To facilitate practical implementation, we have developed
an R package called IsoPriceR. By addressing the challenge of pricing insurance
policies in the absence of historical data, this method helps enhance pricing
strategies in emerging markets.
