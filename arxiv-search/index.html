                    <h3>Cooperative Differential GNSS Positioning: Estimators and Bounds</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Helena Calatrava, Daniel Medina, Pau Closas</p>
                    <p>In Differential GNSS (DGNSS) positioning, differencing measurements between a user and a reference station suppresses common-mode errors but also introduces reference-station noise, which fundamentally limits accuracy. This limitation is minor for high-grade stations but becomes significant when using reference infrastructure of mixed quality. This paper investigates how large-scale user cooperation can mitigate the impact of reference-station noise in conventional (non-cooperative) DGNSS systems. We develop a unified estimation framework for cooperative DGNSS (C-DGNSS) and cooperative real-time kinematic (C-RTK) positioning, and derive parameterized expressions for their Fisher information matrices as functions of network size, satellite geometry, and reference-station noise. This formulation enables theoretical analysis of estimation performance, identifying regimes where cooperation asymptotically restores the accuracy of DGNSS with an ideal (noise-free) reference. Simulations validate these theoretical findings.</p>

                    <h3>Detecting Stochasticity in Discrete Signals via Nonparametric Excursion Theorem</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunia Tanweer, Firas A. Khasawneh</p>
                    <p>We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\varepsilon)=N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales.</p>

                    <h3>Multi-task Modeling for Engineering Applications with Sparse Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yigitcan Comlek, R. Murali Krishnan, Sandipp Krishnan Ravi, Amin Moghaddas, Rafael Giorjao, Michael Eff, Anirban Samaddar, Nesar S. Ramachandra, Sandeep Madireddy, Liping Wang</p>
                    <p>Modern engineering and scientific workflows often require simultaneous predictions across related tasks and fidelity levels, where high-fidelity data is scarce and expensive, while low-fidelity data is more abundant. This paper introduces an Multi-Task Gaussian Processes (MTGP) framework tailored for engineering systems characterized by multi-source, multi-fidelity data, addressing challenges of data sparsity and varying task correlations. The proposed framework leverages inter-task relationships across outputs and fidelity levels to improve predictive performance and reduce computational costs. The framework is validated across three representative scenarios: Forrester function benchmark, 3D ellipsoidal void modeling, and friction-stir welding. By quantifying and leveraging inter-task relationships, the proposed MTGP framework offers a robust and scalable solution for predictive modeling in domains with significant computational and experimental costs, supporting informed decision-making and efficient resource utilization.</p>

                    <h3>Neural Methods for Multiple Systems Estimation Models</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Marsh, Nathan A. Judd, Lax Chan, Rowland G. Seymour</p>
                    <p>Estimating the size of hidden populations using Multiple Systems Estimation (MSE) is a critical task in quantitative sociology; however, practical application is often hindered by imperfect administrative data and computational constraints. Real-world datasets frequently suffer from censoring and missingness due to privacy concerns, while standard inference methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), can become computationally intractable or fail to converge when data are sparse. To address these limitations, we propose a novel simulation-based Bayesian inference framework utilizing Neural Bayes Estimators (NBE) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPE). These neural methods are amortized: once trained, they provide instantaneous, computationally efficient posterior estimates, making them ideal for use in secure research environments where computational resources are limited. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that neural estimators achieve accuracy comparable to MCMC while being orders of magnitude faster and robust to the convergence failures that plague traditional samplers in sparse settings. We demonstrate our method on two real-world cases estimating the prevalence of modern slavery in the UK and female drug use in North East England.</p>

                    <h3>A latent factor approach to hyperspectral time series data for multivariate genomic prediction of grain yield in wheat</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan F. Kunst, Killian A. C. Melsen, Willem Kruijer, José Crossa, Chris Maliepaard, Fred A. van Eeuwijk, Carel F. W. Peeters</p>
                    <p>High-dimensional time series phenotypic data is becoming increasingly common within plant breeding programmes. However, analysing and integrating such data for genetic analysis and genomic prediction remains difficult. Here we show how factor analysis with Procrustes rotation on the genetic correlation matrix of hyperspectral secondary phenotype data can help in extracting relevant features for within-trial prediction. We use a subset of Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo (CIMMYT) elite yield wheat trial of 2014-2015, consisting of 1,033 genotypes. These were measured across three irrigation treatments at several timepoints during the season, using manned airplane flights with hyperspectral sensors capturing 62 bands in the spectrum of 385-850 nm. We perform multivariate genomic prediction using latent variables to improve within-trial genomic predictive ability (PA) of wheat grain yield within three distinct watering treatments. By integrating latent variables of the hyperspectral data in a multivariate genomic prediction model, we are able to achieve an absolute gain of .1 to .3 (on the correlation scale) in PA compared to univariate genomic prediction. Furthermore, we show which timepoints within a trial are important and how these relate to plant growth stages. This paper showcases how domain knowledge and data-driven approaches can be combined to increase PA and gain new insights from sensor data of high-throughput phenotyping platforms.</p>

                    <h3>Buffered AUC maximization for scoring systems via mixed-integer optimization</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moe Shiina, Shunnosuke Ikeda, Yuichi Takano</p>
                    <p>A scoring system is a linear classifier composed of a small number of explanatory variables, each assigned a small integer coefficient. This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression. This research contributes to the advancement of MIO techniques for developing highly interpretable classification models.</p>

                    <h3>Efficient Inference for Noisy LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqun T Chen, Sizhu Lu, Sijia Li, Moran Guo, Shengyi Li</p>
                    <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic evaluators of generative AI outputs, a paradigm often referred to as "LLM-as-a-judge." In practice, LLM judges are imperfect predictions for the underlying truth and can exhibit systematic, non-random errors. Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections. We verify our theoretical results in simulations and demonstrate the methods on real-data examples. We provide an implementation of the benchmarked methods and comparison utilities at https://github.com/yiqunchen/debias-llm-as-a-judge.</p>

                    <h3>Representing asymmetric relationships by h-plots. Discovering the archetypal patterns of cross-journal citation relationships</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleix Alcacer, Irene Epifanio</p>
                    <p>This work approaches the multidimensional scaling problem from a novel angle. We introduce a scalable method based on the h-plot, which inherently accommodates asymmetric proximity data. Instead of embedding the objects themselves, the method embeds the variables that define the proximity to or from each object. It is straightforward to implement, and the quality of the resulting representation can be easily evaluated. The methodology is illustrated by visualizing the asymmetric relationships between the citing and cited profiles of journals on a common map. Two profiles that are far apart (or close together) in the h-plot, as measured by Euclidean distance, are different (or similar), respectively. This representation allows archetypoid analysis (ADA) to be calculated. ADA is used to find archetypal journals (or extreme cases). We can represent the dataset as convex combinations of these archetypal journals, making the results easy to interpret, even for non-experts. Comparisons with other methodologies are carried out, showing the good performance of our proposal. Code and data are available for reproducibility.</p>

                    <h3>Uncertainty Analysis of Experimental Parameters for Reducing Warpage in Injection Molding</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yezhuo Li, Fan Zhang, Dhanashree Shinde, Qiong Zhang, Sai Pradeep, Srikanth Pilla, Gang Li</p>
                    <p>Injection molding is a critical manufacturing process, but controlling warpage remains a major challenge due to complex thermomechanical interactions. Simulation-based optimization is widely used to address this, yet traditional methods often overlook the uncertainty in model parameters. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework to minimize warpage and quantify the uncertainty of optimal process settings. We employ polynomial regression models as surrogates for the injection molding simulations of a box-shaped part. By adopting a Bayesian framework, we estimate the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients. This approach allows us to generate a distribution of optimal decisions rather than a single point estimate, providing a measure of solution robustness. Furthermore, we develop a Monte Carlo-based boundary analysis method. This method constructs confidence bands for the zero-level sets of the response surfaces, helping to visualize the regions where warpage transitions between convex and concave profiles. We apply this framework to optimize four key process parameters: mold temperature, injection speed, packing pressure, and packing time. The results show that our approach finds stable process settings and clearly marks the boundaries of defects in the parameter space.</p>

                    <h3>Rotational Kinematics in the Globular Cluster System of M31: Insights from Bayesian Inference</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong>  Yuan,  Li, Brendon J. Brewer, Geraint F. Lewis, Dougal Mackey</p>
                    <p>As ancient stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) offer valuable insights into the dynamical histories of large galaxies. Previous studies of GC populations in the inner and outer regions of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) have revealed intriguing subpopulations with distinct kinematic properties. Here, we build upon earlier studies by employing Bayesian modelling to investigate the kinematics of the combined inner and outer GC populations of M31. Given the heterogeneous nature of the data, we examine subpopulations defined by GCs' metallicity and by associations with substructure, in order to characterise possible relationships between the inner and outer GC populations. We find that lower-metallicity GCs and those linked to substructures exhibit a common, more rapid rotation, whose alignment is distinct from that of higher-metallicity and non-substructure GCs. Furthermore, the higher-metallicity GCs rotate in alignment with Andromeda's stellar disk. These pronounced kinematic differences reinforce the idea that different subgroups of GCs were accreted to M31 at distinct epochs, shedding light on the complex assembly history of the galaxy.</p>
