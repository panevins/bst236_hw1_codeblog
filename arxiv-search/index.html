                    <h3>Gradient-free ensemble transform methods for generalized Bayesian inference in generative models</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diksha Bhandari, Sebastian Reich</p>
                    <p>Bayesian inference in complex generative models is often obstructed by the absence of tractable likelihoods and the infeasibility of computing gradients of high-dimensional simulators. Existing likelihood-free methods for generalized Bayesian inference typically rely on gradient-based optimization or reparameterization, which can be computationally expensive and often inapplicable to black-box simulators. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a gradient-free ensemble transform Langevin dynamics method for generalized Bayesian inference using the maximum mean discrepancy. By relying on ensemble-based covariance structures rather than simulator derivatives, the proposed method enables robust posterior approximation without requiring access to gradients of the forward model, making it applicable to a broader class of likelihood-free models. The method is affine invariant, computationally efficient, and robust to model misspecification. Through numerical experiments on well-specified chaotic dynamical systems, and misspecified generative models with contaminated data, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or improved accuracy relative to existing gradient-based methods, while substantially reducing computational cost.</p>

                    <h3>Bayesian optimization for re-analysis and calibration of extreme sea state events simulated with a spectral third-generation wave model</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cédric Goeury, Thierry Fouquet, Maria Teles, Michel Benoit</p>
                    <p>Accurate hindcasting of extreme sea state events is essential for coastal engineering, risk assessment, and climate studies. However, the reliability of numerical wave models remains limited by uncertainties in physical parameterizations and model inputs. This study presents a novel calibration framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO), leveraging the Tree structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to efficiently estimate uncertain sink term parameters, specifically bottom friction dissipation, depth induced breaking, and wave dissipation from strong opposing currents, in the ANEMOC-3 hindcast wave model. The proposed method enables joint optimization of continuous parameters and discrete model structures, significantly reducing discrepancies between model outputs and observations. Applied to a one month period encompassing multiple intense storm events along the French Atlantic coast, the calibrated model demonstrates improved agreement with buoy measurements, achieving lower bias, RMSE, and scatter index relative to the default sea$-$state solver configuration. The results highlight the potential of BO to automate and enhance wave model calibration, offering a scalable and flexible approach applicable to a wide range of geophysical modeling problems. Future extensions include multi-objective optimization, uncertainty quantification, and integration of additional observational datasets.</p>

                    <h3>Probability-Aware Parking Selection</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cameron Hickert, Sirui Li, Zhengbing He, Cathy Wu</p>
                    <p>Current parking navigation systems often underestimate total travel time by failing to account for the time spent searching for a parking space, which significantly affects user experience, mode choice, congestion, and emissions. To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows. In data-based simulations, probability-aware strategies demonstrate time savings up to 66% relative to probability-unaware baselines, yet still take up to 123% longer than direct-to-destination estimates.</p>

                    <h3>Continuous monitoring of delayed outcomes in basket trials</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcio A. Diniz, Hulya Kocyigit, Erin Moshier, Madhu Mazumdar, Deukwoo Kwon</p>
                    <p>Precision medicine has led to a paradigm shift allowing the development of targeted drugs that are agnostic to the tumor location. In this context, basket trials aim to identify which tumor types - or baskets - would benefit from the targeted therapy among patients with the same molecular marker or mutation. We propose the implementation of continuous monitoring for basket trials to increase the likelihood of early identification of non-promising baskets. Although the current Bayesian trial designs available in the literature can incorporate more than one interim analysis, most of them have high computational cost, and none of them handle delayed outcomes that are expected for targeted treatments such as immunotherapies. We leverage the Bayesian empirical approach proposed by Fujiwara et al., which has low computational cost. We also extend ideas of Cai et al to address the practical challenge of performing interim analysis with delayed outcomes using multiple imputation. Operating characteristics of four different strategies to handle delayed outcomes in basket trials are compared in an extensive simulation study with the benchmark strategy where trial accrual is put on hold until complete data is observed to make a decision. The optimal handling of missing data at interim analyses is trial-dependent. With slow accrual, missingness is minimal even with continuous monitoring, favoring simpler approaches over computationally intensive methods. Although individual sample-size savings are small, multiple imputation becomes more appealing when sample size savings scale with the number of baskets and agents tested.</p>

                    <h3>The Weather Paradox: Why Precipitation Fails to Predict Traffic Accident Severity in Large-Scale US Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yann Bellec, Rohan Kaman, Siwen Cui, Aarav Agrawal, Calvin Chen</p>
                    <p>This study investigates the predictive capacity of environmental, temporal, and spatial factors on traffic accident severity in the United States. Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets. These findings contribute to evidence-based traffic management and suggest future directions for severity prediction research.</p>

                    <h3>Subgroup Identification and Individualized Treatment Policies: A Tutorial on the Hybrid Two-Stage Workflow</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Miles Xi, Xin Huang, Lin Wang</p>
                    <p>Patients in clinical studies often exhibit heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE). Classical subgroup analyses provide inferential tools to test for effect modification, while modern machine learning methods estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) to enable individual level prediction. Each paradigm has limitations: inference focused approaches may sacrifice predictive utility, and prediction focused approaches often lack statistical guarantees. We present a hybrid two-stage workflow that integrates these perspectives. Stage 1 applies statistical inference to test whether credible treatment effect heterogeneity exists with the protection against spurious findings. Stage 2 translates heterogeneity evidence into individualized treatment policies, evaluated by cross fitted doubly robust (DR) metrics with Neyman-Pearson (NP) constraints on harm. We illustrate the workflow with working examples based on simulated data and a real ACTG 175 HIV trial. This tutorial provides practical implementation checklists and discusses links to sponsor oriented HTE workflows, offering a transparent and auditable pathway from heterogeneity assessment to individualized treatment policies.</p>

                    <h3>The Impact of LLMs on Online News Consumption and Production</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hangcheng Zhao, Ron Berman</p>
                    <p>Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news "slop." Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.
  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.
  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.</p>

                    <h3>Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation for a Genuinely Unbalanced Dynamic Network Panel Data Model</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijian Wang, Xingbai Xu, Tuo Liu</p>
                    <p>This paper develops a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for genuinely unbalanced dynamic network panel data models with individual fixed effects. We propose a model that accommodates contemporaneous and lagged network spillovers, temporal dependence, and a listing effect that activates upon a unit's first appearance in the panel. We establish the consistency of the QMLE as both $N$ and $T$ go to infinity, derive its asymptotic distribution, and identify an asymptotic bias arising from incidental parameters when $N$ is asymptotically large relative to $T$. Based on the asymptotic bias expression, we propose a bias-corrected estimator that is asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed under appropriate regularity conditions. Monte Carlo experiments examine the finite sample performance of the bias-corrected estimator across different criteria, including bias, RMSE, coverage probability, and the normality of the estimator. The empirical application to Airbnb listings from New Zealand and New York City reveals region-specific patterns in spatial and temporal price transmission, illustrating the importance of modeling genuine unbalancedness in dynamic network settings.</p>

                    <h3>$\ell_0$-Regularized Item Response Theory Model for Robust Ideal Point Estimation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwangok Seo, Johan Lim, Seokho Lee, Jong Hee Park</p>
                    <p>Ideal point estimation methods face a significant challenge when legislators engage in protest voting -- strategically voting against their party to express dissatisfaction. Such votes introduce attenuation bias, making ideologically extreme legislators appear artificially moderate. We propose a novel statistical framework that extends the fast EM-based estimation approach of \cite{Imai2016} using $\ell_0$ regularization method to handle protest votes. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method maintains estimation accuracy even with high proportions of protest votes, while being substantially faster than MCMC-based methods. Applying our method to the 116th and 117th U.S. House of Representatives, we successfully recover the extreme liberal positions of ``the Squad'', whose protest votes had caused conventional methods to misclassify them as moderates. While conventional methods rank Ocasio-Cortez as more conservative than 69\% of Democrats, our method places her firmly in the progressive wing, aligning with her documented policy positions. This approach provides both robust ideal point estimates and systematic identification of protest votes, facilitating deeper analysis of strategic voting behavior in legislatures.</p>

                    <h3>Power Analysis is Essential: High-Powered Tests Suggest Minimal to No Effect of Rounded Shapes on Click-Through Rates</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ron Kohavi, Jakub Linowski, Lukas Vermeer, Fabrice Boisseranc, Joachim Furuseth, Andrew Gelman, Guido Imbens, Ravikiran Rajagopal</p>
                    <p>Underpowered studies (below 50%) suffer from the winner's curse: a statistically significant result must exaggerate the true treatment effect to meet the significance threshold. A study by Dipayan Biswas, Annika Abell, and Roger Chacko published in the Journal of Consumer Research (2023) reported that in an A/B test simply rounding the corners of square buttons increased the online click-through rate by 55% (p-value 0.037)$\unicode{x2014}$a striking finding with potentially wide-ranging implications for the digital industry that is seeking to enhance consumer engagement. Drawing on our experience with tens of thousands of A/B tests, many involving similar user interface modifications, we found this dramatic claim implausibly large. To evaluate the claim, we conducted three high-powered A/B tests, each involving over two thousand times more users than the original study. All three experiments yielded effect size estimates that were approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than initially reported, with 95% confidence intervals that include zero, that is, not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Two additional independent replications by Evidoo found similarly small effects. These findings underscore the critical importance of power analysis and experimental design to increase trust and reproducibility of results.</p>
