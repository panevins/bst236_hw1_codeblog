                    <h3>Index-Tracking Portfolio Construction and Rebalancing under Bayesian Sparse Modelling and Uncertainty Quantification</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Roxanas</p>
                    <p>We study the construction and rebalancing of sparse index-tracking portfolios from an operational research perspective, with explicit emphasis on uncertainty quantification and implementability. The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing.</p>

                    <h3>Dynamic Attention (DynAttn): Interpretable High-Dimensional Spatio-Temporal Forecasting (with Application to Conflict Fatalities)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano M. Iacus, Haodong Qi, Marcello Carammia, Thomas Juneau</p>
                    <p>Forecasting conflict-related fatalities remains a central challenge in political science and policy analysis due to the sparse, bursty, and highly non-stationary nature of violence data. We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures.
  We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply.
  Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.</p>

                    <h3>Standardized Descriptive Index for Measuring Deviation and Uncertainty in Psychometric Indicators</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark Dominique Dalipe Muñoz</p>
                    <p>The use of descriptive statistics in pilot testing procedures requires objective, standard diagnostic tools that are feasible for small sample sizes. While current psychometric practices report item-level statistics, they often report these raw descriptives separately rather than consolidating both mean and standard deviation into a single diagnostic tool to directly measure item quality. By leveraging the analytical properties of Cohen's d, this article repurposes its use in scale development as a standardized item deviation index. This measures the extent of an item's raw deviation relative to its scale midpoint while accounting for its own uncertainty. Analytical properties such as boundedness, scale invariance, and bias are explored to further understand how the index values behave, which will aid future efforts to establish empirical thresholds that characterize redundancy among formative indicators and consistency among reflective indicators.</p>

                    <h3>Modeling gap acceptance behavior allowing for perceptual distortions and exogenous influences</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankita Sharma, Partha Chakroborty, Pranamesh Chakraborty</p>
                    <p>This work on gap acceptance is based on the premise that the decision to accept/reject a gap happens in a person's mind and therefore must be based on the perceived gap and not the measured gap. The critical gap must also exist in a person's mind and hence, together with the perceived gap, is a latent variable. Finally, it is also proposed that the critical gap is influenced by various exogenous variables such as subject and opposing vehicle types, and perceived waiting time. Mathematical models that (i) incorporate systematic and random distortions during the perception process and (ii) account for the effect of the various influencing variables are developed. The parameters of these models are estimated for two different gap acceptance data sets using the maximum likelihood technique. The data is collected as part of this study. The estimated parameters throw valuable insights into how these influencing variables affect the critical gap. The results corroborate the initial predictions on the nature of influence these variables must exert and give strength to the gap acceptance decision-making construct proposed here. This work also proposes a methodology to estimate a measurable/observable world emulator of the latent variable critical gap. The use of the emulator critical gap provides improved estimates of derived quantities like the average waiting time of subject vehicles. Finally, studies are also conducted to show that the number of rejected gaps can work as a reasonable surrogate for the influencing variable, waiting time.</p>

                    <h3>Invariant Feature Extraction Through Conditional Independence and the Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem: the Gaussian case</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian Bounos, Pablo Groisman, Mariela Sued, Esteban Tabak</p>
                    <p>A methodology is developed to extract $d$ invariant features $W=f(X)$ that predict a response variable $Y$ without being confounded by variables $Z$ that may influence both $X$ and $Y$.
  The methodology's main ingredient is the penalization of any statistical dependence between $W$ and $Z$ conditioned on $Y$, replaced by the more readily implementable plain independence between $W$ and the random variable $Z_Y = T(Z,Y)$ that solves the [Monge] Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem for $Z\mid Y$. In the Gaussian case considered in this article, the two statements are equivalent.
  When the true confounders $Z$ are unknown, other measurable contextual variables $S$ can be used as surrogates, a replacement that involves no relaxation in the Gaussian case if the covariance matrix $Σ_{ZS}$ has full range. The resulting linear feature extractor adopts a closed form in terms of the first $d$ eigenvectors of a known matrix. The procedure extends with little change to more general, non-Gaussian / non-linear cases.</p>

                    <h3>The Area Signal-to-Noise Ratio: A Robust Alternative to Peak-Based SNR in Spectroscopic Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Yu, Huaqing Zhao, Lin Z. Li</p>
                    <p>In spectroscopic analysis, the peak-based signal-to-noise ratio (pSNR) is commonly used but suffers from limitations such as sensitivity to noise spikes and reduced effectiveness for broader peaks. We introduce the area-based signal-to-noise ratio (aSNR) as a robust alternative that integrates the signal over a defined region of interest, reducing noise variance and improving detection for various lineshapes. We used Monte Carlo simulations (n=2,000 trials per condition) to test aSNR on Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt lineshapes. We found that aSNR requires significantly lower amplitudes than pSNR to achieve a 50% detection probability. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves show that aSNR performs better than pSNR at low amplitudes. Our results show that aSNR works especially advantageously for broad peaks and could be extended to volume-based SNR for multidimensional spectra.</p>

                    <h3>The Whittle likelihood for mixed models with application to groundwater level time series</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakub J. Pypkowski, Adam M. Sykulski, James S. Martin, Ben P. Marchant</p>
                    <p>Understanding the processes that influence groundwater levels is crucial for forecasting and responding to hazards such as groundwater droughts. Mixed models, which combine a fixed mean, expressed using independent predictors, with autocorrelated random errors, are used for inference, forecasting and filling in missing values in groundwater level time series. Estimating parameters of mixed models using maximum likelihood has high computational complexity. For large datasets, this leads to restrictive simplifying assumptions such as fixing certain free parameters in practical implementations. In this paper, we propose a method to jointly estimate all parameters of mixed models using the Whittle likelihood, a frequency-domain quasi-likelihood. Our method is robust to missing and non-Gaussian data and can handle much larger data sizes. We demonstrate the utility of our method both in a simulation study and with real-world data, comparing against maximum likelihood and an alternative two-stage approach that estimates fixed and random effect parameters separately.</p>

                    <h3>A Profit-Based Measure of Lending Discrimination</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madison Coots, Robert Bartlett, Julian Nyarko, Sharad Goel</p>
                    <p>Algorithmic lending has transformed the consumer credit landscape, with complex machine learning models now commonly used to make or assist underwriting decisions. To comply with fair lending laws, these algorithms typically exclude legally protected characteristics, such as race and gender. Yet algorithmic underwriting can still inadvertently favor certain groups, prompting new questions about how to audit lending algorithms for potentially discriminatory behavior. Building on prior theoretical work, we introduce a profit-based measure of lending discrimination in loan pricing. Applying our approach to approximately 80,000 personal loans from a major U.S. fintech platform, we find that loans made to men and Black borrowers yielded lower profits than loans to other groups, indicating that men and Black applicants benefited from relatively favorable lending decisions. We trace these disparities to miscalibration in the platform's underwriting model, which underestimates credit risk for Black borrowers and overestimates risk for women. We show that one could correct this miscalibration -- and the corresponding lending disparities -- by explicitly including race and gender in underwriting models, illustrating a tension between competing notions of fairness.</p>

                    <h3>Switching between states and the COVID-19 turbulence</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilias Aarab</p>
                    <p>In Aarab (2020), I examine U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document evidence of time-varying expected returns across market states in the long run. The analysis introduces a state-switching specification in which the market state is proxied by the slope of the yield curve, and proposes an Aligned Economic Index built from the popular predictors of Welch and Goyal (2008) (augmented with bond and equity premium measures). The Aligned Economic Index under the state-switching model exhibits statistically and economically meaningful in-sample ($R^2 = 5.9\%$) and out-of-sample ($R^2_{\text{oos}} = 4.12\%$) predictive power across both recessions and expansions, while outperforming a range of widely used predictors. In this work, I examine the added value for professional practitioners by computing the economic gains for a mean-variance investor and find substantial added benefit of using the new index under the state switching model across all market states. The Aligned Economic Index can thus be implemented on a consistent real-time basis. These findings are crucial for both academics and practitioners as expansions are much longer-lived than recessions. Finally, I extend the empirical exercises by incorporating data through September 2020 and document sizable gains from using the Aligned Economic Index, relative to more traditional approaches, during the COVID-19 market turbulence.</p>

                    <h3>The Aligned Economic Index & The State Switching Model</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilias Aarab</p>
                    <p>A growing empirical literature suggests that equity-premium predictability is state dependent, with much of the forecasting power concentrated around recessionary periods \parencite{Henkel2011,DanglHalling2012,Devpura2018}. I study U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document strong evidence of time-varying expected returns across both expansionary and contractionary states. I contribute in two ways. First, I introduce a state-switching predictive regression in which the market state is defined in real time using the slope of the yield curve. Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by \textcite{WelchGoyal2008}, improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS). Under the state-switching model, the Aligned Economic Index exhibits statistically and economically significant predictive power in sample and out of sample, and it outperforms widely used benchmark predictors and alternative predictor-combination methods.</p>
