                    <h3>Robust variance estimators in application to segmentation of measurement
  data distorted by impulsive and non-Gaussian noise</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justyna Witulska, Anna Zaleska, Natalia Kremzer-Osiadacz, Agnieszka Wyłomańska, Ireneusz Jabłoński</p>
                    <p>  The paper algorithmizes the problem of regime change point identification for
data measured in a system exhibiting impulsive behaviors. This is a fundamental
challenge for annotation of measurement data relevant, e.g., for designing
data-driven autonomous systems. The contribution consists in the formulation of
an offline robust methodology based on the classical approach for structural
break detection. The problem of data segmentation is considered in the context
of scale change, which physically can be translated into the occurrence of a
critical event that reorganizes the system structure. The main advantage of our
approach is that it does not require the existence of a variance of the data
distribution. The efficiency has been evaluated for simulated data from two
distributions and for real-world datasets measured in financial, mechanical,
and medical systems. Simulation studies show that in the most challenging case,
the error in estimating regime change is 20 times smaller for robust approach
compared to the classical one.

                    <h3>Assessing the Accuracy of Multisource Register-based Official Statistics
  for Multinomial Outcomes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nina Deliu, Piero Demetrio Falorsi, Stefano Falorsi, Diego Chianella, Giorgio Alleva</p>
                    <p>  The emergence of new data sources and statistical methods is driving an
update in the traditional official statistics paradigm. As an example, the
Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) is undergoing a significant
modernisation of the data production process, transitioning from a statistical
paradigm based on single sources (census, sample surveys, or administrative
data) to an integrated system of statistical registers. The latter results from
an integration process of administrative and survey data based on different
statistical methods, and, as such, prone to different sources of error. This
work discusses and validates a global measure of error assessment for such
multisource register-based statistics. Focusing on two important sources of
uncertainty (sampling and modelling), we provide an analytical solution that
well approximates the global error of mass-imputation procedures for
multi-category type of outcomes, assuming a multinomial logistic model. Among
other advantages, the proposed measure results in an interpretable,
computationally feasible, and flexible approach, while allowing for unplanned
on-the-fly statistics on totals to be supported by accuracy estimates. An
application to education data from the Base Register of Individuals from
ISTAT's integrated system of statistical registers is presented.

  objectives and quantitative optimization</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stig Johan Wiklund, Magnus Ytterstad, Frank Miller</p>
                    <p>  Many pharmaceutical companies face concerns with the maintenance of desired
revenue levels. Sales forecasts for the current portfolio of products and
projects may indicate a decline in revenue as the marketed products approach
patent expiry. To counteract the potential downturn in revenue, and to
establish revenue growth, an in-flow of new projects into the development
phases is required. In this article, we devise an approach with which the
in-flow of new projects could be optimized, while adhering to the objectives
and constraints set on revenue targets, budget limitations and strategic
considerations on the composition of the company's portfolio.

                    <h3>A Novel Hybrid Approach to Contraceptive Demand Forecasting: Integrating
  Point Predictions with Probabilistic Distributions</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsha Chamara Hewage, Bahman Rostami-Tabar, Aris Syntetos, Federico Liberatore, Glenn Milano</p>
                    <p>  Accurate demand forecasting is vital for ensuring reliable access to
contraceptive products, supporting key processes like procurement, inventory,
and distribution. However, forecasting contraceptive demand in developing
countries presents challenges, including incomplete data, poor data quality,
and the need to account for multiple geographical and product factors. Current
methods often rely on simple forecasting techniques, which fail to capture
demand uncertainties arising from these factors, warranting expert involvement.
Our study aims to improve contraceptive demand forecasting by combining
probabilistic forecasting methods with expert knowledge. We developed a hybrid
model that combines point forecasts from domain-specific model with
probabilistic distributions from statistical and machine learning approaches,
enabling human input to fine-tune and enhance the system-generated forecasts.
This approach helps address the uncertainties in demand and is particularly
useful in resource-limited settings. We evaluate different forecasting methods,
including time series, Bayesian, machine learning, and foundational time series
methods alongside our new hybrid approach. By comparing these methods, we
provide insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and computational
requirements. Our research fills a gap in forecasting contraceptive demand and
offers a practical framework that combines algorithmic and human expertise. Our
proposed model can also be generalized to other humanitarian contexts with
similar data patterns.

                    <h3>Bayesian Matrix Factor Models for Demographic Analysis Across Age and
  Time</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregor Zens</p>
                    <p>  Analyzing demographic data collected across multiple populations, time
periods, and age groups is challenging due to the interplay of high
dimensionality, demographic heterogeneity among groups, and stochastic
variability within smaller groups. This paper proposes a Bayesian matrix factor
model to address these challenges. By factorizing count data matrices as the
product of low-dimensional latent age and time factors, the model achieves a
parsimonious representation that mitigates overfitting and remains
computationally feasible even when hundreds of subpopulations are involved.
Smoothness in age factors and a dynamic evolution of time factors are achieved
through informative priors, and an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
is developed for posterior inference. Applying the model to Austrian
district-level emigration data from 2002 to 2023 demonstrates its ability to
reconstruct demographic processes using only a fraction of the parameters
required by conventional factor models. Extensive cross-validation and
out-of-sample forecasting exercises show that the proposed matrix factor model
consistently outperforms standard benchmarks. Beyond statistical demography,
the framework holds promise for a wide range of applications involving noisy,
heterogeneous, and high-dimensional non-Gaussian matrix-valued data.

                    <h3>Sequential Covariance Fitting for InSAR Phase Linking</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dana El Hajjar, Guillaume Ginolhac, Yajing Yan, Mohammed Nabil El Korso</p>
                    <p>  Traditional Phase-Linking (PL) algorithms are known for their high cost,
especially with the huge volume of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images
generated by Sentinel-1 SAR missions. Recently, a COvariance Fitting
Interferometric Phase Linking (COFI-PL) approach has been proposed, which can
be seen as a generic framework for existing PL methods. Although this method is
less computationally expensive than traditional PL approaches, COFI-PL exploits
the entire covariance matrix, which poses a challenge with the increasing time
series of SAR images. However, COFI-PL, like traditional PL approaches, cannot
accommodate the efficient inclusion of newly acquired SAR images. This paper
overcomes this drawback by introducing a sequential integration of a block of
newly acquired SAR images. Specifically, we propose a method for effectively
addressing optimization problems associated with phase-only complex vectors on
the torus based on the Majorization-Minimization framework.

                    <h3>A Differential Index Measuring Rater's Capability in Educational
  Assessment</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. -G. Wang, J. Wu, X. Qiu</p>
                    <p>  A rater's ability to assign accurate scores can significantly impact the
outcomes of educational assessments. However, common indices for evaluating
rater characteristics typically focus on either their severity or their
discrimination ability (i.e., skills to differentiate between students).
Additionally, these indices are often developed without considering the rater's
accuracy in scoring students at different ability levels. To address the
limitations, this study proposes a single-value measure to assess a rater's
capability of assigning accurate scores to students with varying ability
levels. The measure is derived from the partial derivatives of each rater's
passing rate concerning student ability. Mathematical derivations of the index
under generalized multi-facet models and hierarchical rater models are
provided. To ease the implementation of the index, this study develops
parameter estimation using marginal likelihood and its Laplacian approximation
which allows for efficient evaluation and processing of large datasets
involving numerous students and raters. Simulation studies demonstrate the
accuracy of parameter recovery using the approximate likelihood and show how
the capability indices vary with different levels of rater severity. An
empirical study further tests the practical applicability of the new measure,
where raters evaluate essays on four topics: "family," "school," "sport," and
"work." Results show that raters are most capable when rating the topic of
family and least capable when rating sport, with individual raters displaying
different capabilities across the various topics.

                    <h3>Warnings based on risk matrices: a coherent framework with consistent
  evaluation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert J. Taggart, David J. Wilke</p>
                    <p>  Risk matrices are widely used across a range of fields and have found
increasing utility in warning decision practices globally. However, their
application in this context presents challenges, which range from potentially
perverse warning outcomes to a lack of objective verification (i.e.,
evaluation) methods. This paper introduces a coherent framework for generating
multi-level warnings from risk matrices to address these challenges. The
proposed framework is general, is based on probabilistic forecasts of hazard
severity or impact and is compatible with the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).
Moreover, it includes a family of consistent scoring functions for objectively
evaluating the predictive performance of risk matrix assessments and the
warnings they produce. These scoring functions enable the ranking of
forecasters or warning systems and the tracking of system improvements by
rewarding accurate probabilistic forecasts and compliance with warning service
directives. A synthetic experiment demonstrates the efficacy of these scoring
functions, while the framework is illustrated through warnings for heavy
rainfall based on operational ensemble prediction system forecasts for Tropical
Cyclone Jasper (Queensland, Australia, 2023). This work establishes a robust
foundation for enhancing the reliability and verifiability of risk-based
warning systems.

  to long-memory in high-dimensional time series</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreya Mehta, Almut E. D. Veraart</p>
                    <p>  This article introduces Levy-driven graph supOU processes, offering a
parsimonious parametrisation for high-dimensional time-series, where
dependencies between the individual components are governed via a graph
structure. Specifically, we propose a model specification that allows for a
smooth transition between short- and long-memory settings while accommodating a
wide range of marginal distributions.
  We further develop an inference procedure based on the generalised method of
moments, establish its asymptotic properties and demonstrate its strong finite
sample performance through a simulation study.
  Finally, we illustrate the practical relevance of our new model and
estimation method in an empirical study of wind capacity factors in an European
electricity network context.

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asmik Nalmpatian, Christian Heumann</p>
                    <p>  This study presents a framework for high-resolution mortality simulations
tailored to insured and general populations. Due to the scarcity of detailed
demographic-specific mortality data, we leverage Iterative Proportional Fitting
(IPF) and Monte Carlo simulations to generate refined mortality tables that
incorporate age, gender, smoker status, and regional distributions. This
methodology enhances public health planning and actuarial analysis by providing
enriched datasets for improved life expectancy projections and insurance
product development.
