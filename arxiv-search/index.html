                    <h3>A Robust Local Fréchet Regression Using Unbalanced Neural Optimal
  Transport with Applications to Dynamic Single-cell Genomics Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Binghao Yan, Hongzhe Li</p>
                    <p>  Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have enabled the
profiling of gene expression for a collection of cells across time during a
dynamic biological process. Given that each time point provides only a static
snapshot, modeling and understanding the underlying cellular dynamics remains a
central yet challenging task in modern genomics. To associate biological time
with single cell distributions, we develop a robust local Fr\'echet regression
for interpolating the high-dimensional cellular distribution at any given time
point using data observed over a finite time points. To allow for robustness in
cell distributions, we propose to apply the unbalanced optimal transport-based
Wasserstein distance in our local Fr\'echet regression analysis. We develop a
computationally efficient algorithm to generate the cell distribution for a
given time point using generative neural networks. The resulting single cell
generated models and the corresponding transport plans can be use to
interpolate the single cells at any unobserved time point and to track the cell
trajectory during the cell differentiation process. We demonstrate the methods
using three single cell differentiation data sets, including differentiation of
human embryonic stem cells into embryoids, mouse hematopoietic and progenitor
cell differentiation, and reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We show
that the proposed methods lead to better single cell interpolations, reveal
different cell differential trajectories, and identify early genes that
regulate these cell trajectories.

                    <h3>Simultaneous hypothesis testing for comparing many functional means</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Colin Decker, Dehan Kong, Stanislav Volgushev</p>
                    <p>  Data with multiple functional recordings at each observational unit are
increasingly common in various fields including medical imaging and
environmental sciences. To conduct inference for such observations, we develop
a paired two-sample test that allows to simultaneously compare the means of
many functional observations while maintaining family-wise error rate control.
We explicitly allow the number of functional recordings to increase,
potentially much faster than the sample size. Our test is fully functional and
does not rely on dimension reduction or functional PCA type approaches or the
choice of tuning parameters. To provide a theoretical justification for the
proposed procedure, we develop a number of new anti-concentration and Gaussian
approximation results for maxima of $L^2$ statistics which might be of
independent interest. The methodology is illustrated on the task-related
cortical surface functional magnetic resonance imaging data from Human
Connectome Project.

                    <h3>On Devon Allen's Disqualification at the 2022 World Track and Field
  Championships</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Owen Fiore, Elizabeth D. Schifano, Jun Yan</p>
                    <p>  Devon Allen's disqualification at the men's 110-meter hurdle final at the
2022 World Track and Field Championships, due to a reaction time (RT) of 0.099
seconds-just 0.001 seconds below the allowable threshold-sparked widespread
debate over the fairness and validity of RT rules. This study investigates two
key issues: variations in timing systems and the justification for the
0.1-second disqualification threshold. We pooled RT data from men's 110-meter
hurdles and 100-meter dash, as well as women's 100-meter hurdles and 100-meter
dash, spanning national and international competitions. Using a rank-sum test
for clustered data, we compared RTs across multiple competitions, while a
generalized Gamma model with random effects for venue and heat was applied to
evaluate the threshold. Our analyses reveal significant differences in RTs
between the 2022 World Championships and other competitions, pointing to
systematic variations in timing systems. Additionally, the model shows that RTs
be low 0.1 seconds, though rare, are physiologically plausible. These findings
highlight the need for standardized timing protocols and a re-evaluation of the
0.1-second disqualification threshold to promote fairness in elite competition.

                    <h3>Time-Varying Home Field Advantage in Football: Learning from a
  Non-Stationary Causal Process</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minhao Qi, Hengrui Cai, Guanyu Hu, Weining Shen</p>
                    <p>  In sports analytics, home field advantage is a robust phenomenon where the
home team wins more games than the away team. However, discovering the causal
factors behind home field advantage presents unique challenges due to the
non-stationary, time-varying environment of sports matches. In response, we
propose a novel causal discovery method, DYnamic Non-stAtionary local
M-estimatOrs (DYNAMO), to learn the time-varying causal structures of home
field advantage. DYNAMO offers flexibility by integrating various loss
functions, making it practical for learning linear and non-linear causal
structures from a general class of non-stationary causal processes. By
leveraging local information, we provide theoretical guarantees for the
identifiability and estimation consistency of non-stationary causal structures
without imposing additional assumptions. Simulation studies validate the
efficacy of DYNAMO in recovering time-varying causal structures. We apply our
method to high-resolution event data from the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 English
Premier League seasons, during which the former season had no audience
presence. Our results reveal intriguing, time-varying, team-specific field
advantages influenced by referee bias, which differ significantly with and
without crowd support. Furthermore, the time-varying causal structures learned
by our method improve goal prediction accuracy compared to existing methods.

  randomized trials and missing effect modifiers</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Williams, Kara Rudolph, Iván Díaz</p>
                    <p>  A fundamental principle of clinical medicine is that a treatment should only
be administered to those patients who would benefit from it. Treatment
strategies that assign treatment to patients as a function of their individual
characteristics are known as dynamic treatment rules. The dynamic treatment
rule that optimizes the outcome in the population is called the optimal dynamic
treatment rule. Randomized clinical trials are considered the gold standard for
estimating the marginal causal effect of a treatment on an outcome; they are
often not powered to detect heterogeneous treatment effects, and thus, may
rarely inform more personalized treatment decisions. The availability of
multiple trials studying a common set of treatments presents an opportunity for
combining data, often called data-fusion, to better estimate dynamic treatment
rules. However, there may be a mismatch in the set of patient covariates
measured across trials. We address this problem here; we propose a
nonparametric estimator for the optimal dynamic treatment rule that leverages
information across the set of randomized trials. We apply the estimator to
fused randomized trials of medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder
to estimate a treatment rule that would match patient subgroups with the
medication that would minimize risk of return to regular opioid use.

                    <h3>A Bayesian Multisource Fusion Model for Spatiotemporal PM2.5 in an Urban
  Setting</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abi I. Riley, Marta Blangiardo, Frédéric B. Piel, Andrew Beddows, Sean Beevers, Gary W. Fuller, Paul Agnew</p>
                    <p>  Airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major public health concern in urban
environments, where population density and emission sources exacerbate exposure
risks. We present a novel Bayesian spatiotemporal fusion model to estimate
monthly PM2.5 concentrations over Greater London (2014-2019) at 1km resolution.
The model integrates multiple PM2.5 data sources, including outputs from two
atmospheric air quality dispersion models and predictive variables, such as
vegetation and satellite aerosol optical depth, while explicitly modelling a
latent spatiotemporal field. Spatial misalignment of the data is addressed
through an upscaling approach to predict across the entire area. Building on
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) within the integrated nested
Laplace approximations (INLA) framework, our method introduces spatially- and
temporally-varying coefficients to flexibly calibrate datasets and capture
fine-scale variability. Model performance and complexity are balanced using
predictive metrics such as the predictive model choice criterion and thorough
cross-validation. The best performing model shows excellent fit and solid
predictive performance, enabling reliable high-resolution spatiotemporal
mapping of PM2.5 concentrations with the associated uncertainty. Furthermore,
the model outputs, including full posterior predictive distributions, can be
used to map exceedance probabilities of regulatory thresholds, supporting air
quality management and targeted interventions in vulnerable urban areas, as
well as providing refined exposure estimates of PM2.5 for epidemiological
applications.

                    <h3>A composition of simplified physics-based model with neural operator for
  trajectory-level seismic response predictions of structural systems</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungho Kim, Sang-ri Yi, Ziqi Wang</p>
                    <p>  Accurate prediction of nonlinear structural responses is essential for
earthquake risk assessment and management. While high-fidelity nonlinear time
history analysis provides the most comprehensive and accurate representation of
the responses, it becomes computationally prohibitive for complex structural
system models and repeated simulations under varying ground motions. To address
this challenge, we propose a composite learning framework that integrates
simplified physics-based models with a Fourier neural operator to enable
efficient and accurate trajectory-level seismic response prediction. In the
proposed architecture, a simplified physics-based model, obtained from
techniques such as linearization, modal reduction, or solver relaxation, serves
as a preprocessing operator to generate structural response trajectories that
capture coarse dynamic characteristics. A neural operator is then trained to
correct the discrepancy between these initial approximations and the true
nonlinear responses, allowing the composite model to capture hysteretic and
path-dependent behaviors. Additionally, a linear regression-based
postprocessing scheme is introduced to further refine predictions and quantify
associated uncertainty with negligible additional computational effort. The
proposed approach is validated on three representative structural systems
subjected to synthetic or recorded ground motions. Results show that the
proposed approach consistently improves prediction accuracy over baseline
models, particularly in data-scarce regimes. These findings demonstrate the
potential of physics-guided operator learning for reliable and data-efficient
modeling of nonlinear structural seismic responses.

                    <h3>Educational Intervention Re-Wires Social Interactions in Isolated
  Village Networks</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marios Papamichalis, Laura Forastiere, Edoardo M. Airoldi, Nicholas A. Christakis</p>
                    <p>  Social networks shape behavior, disseminate information, and undergird
collective action within communities. Consequently, they can be very valuable
in the design of effective interventions to improve community well-being. But
any exogenous intervention in networked groups, including ones that just
involve the provision of information, can also possibly modify the underlying
network structure itself, and some interventions are indeed designed to do so.
While social networks obey certain fundamental principles (captured by
network-level statistics, such as the degree distribution or transitivity
level), they can nevertheless undergo change across time, as people form and
break ties with each other within an overall population. Here, using a
randomized controlled trial in 110 remote Honduran villages involving 8,331
people, we evaluated the effects of a 22-month public health intervention on
pre-existing social network structures. We leverage a two-stage randomized
design, where a varying fraction of households received the intervention in
each village. In low-dosage villages (5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) compared to
untreated villages (0%), over a two-year period, individuals who received the
intervention tended to sever both inbound and outbound ties with untreated
individuals whom they previously trusted for health advice. Conversely, in
high-dosage villages (50%, 75%, and 100%), treated individuals increased both
their inbound and outbound ties. Furthermore, although the intervention was
health-focused, it also reshaped broader friendship and financial ties. In
aggregate, the imposition of a novel health information regime in rural
villages (as a kind of social institution) led to a significant rewiring in
individuals particular connections, but it still had a limited effect on the
overall global structure of the village-wide social networks.

                    <h3>Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an
  interpretability-driven study</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamzah Dabool, Raghad Mustafa</p>
                    <p>  Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

  retention and change</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marian-Gabriel Hâncean, Jürgen Lerner, Christopher McCarty</p>
                    <p>  We conducted a two-wave personal network study in a rural Romanian community,
interviewing the same participants (n = 68) using two name generators. Wave 1
employed a fixed-choice generator (n = 25) focused on emotional closeness; Wave
2 used a free-choice generator based on frequent interaction. We compared tie
characteristics and assessed retention across waves. Alters who were kin,
co-residents, or emotionally close were more likely to be retained, regardless
of generator type. These findings underscore the role of relational attributes
in personal network stability and highlight design considerations for network
studies in resource-limited, culturally distinct settings.
