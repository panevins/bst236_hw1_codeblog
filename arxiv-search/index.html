                    <h3>PRISM-FCP: Byzantine-Resilient Federated Conformal Prediction via Partial Sharing</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ehsan Lari, Reza Arablouei, Stefan Werner</p>
                    <p>We propose PRISM-FCP (Partial shaRing and robust calIbration with Statistical Margins for Federated Conformal Prediction), a Byzantine-resilient federated conformal prediction framework that utilizes partial model sharing to improve robustness against Byzantine attacks during both model training and conformal calibration. Existing approaches address adversarial behavior only in the calibration stage, leaving the learned model susceptible to poisoned updates. In contrast, PRISM-FCP mitigates attacks end-to-end. During training, clients partially share updates by transmitting only $M$ of $D$ parameters per round. This attenuates the expected energy of an adversary's perturbation in the aggregated update by a factor of $M/D$, yielding lower mean-square error (MSE) and tighter prediction intervals. During calibration, clients convert nonconformity scores into characterization vectors, compute distance-based maliciousness scores, and downweight or filter suspected Byzantine contributions before estimating the conformal quantile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Superconductivity dataset demonstrate that PRISM-FCP maintains nominal coverage guarantees under Byzantine attacks while avoiding the interval inflation observed in standard FCP with reduced communication, providing a robust and communication-efficient approach to federated uncertainty quantification.</p>

                    <h3>Hidden multistate models to study multimorbidity trajectories</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentina Manzoni, Francesca Ieva, Amaia Calderón-Larrañaga, Davide Liborio Vetrano, Caterina Gregorio</p>
                    <p>Multimorbidity in older adults is common, heterogeneous, and highly dynamic, and it is strongly associated with disability and increased healthcare utilization. However, existing approaches to studying multimorbidity trajectories are largely descriptive or rely on discrete-time models, which struggle to handle irregular observation intervals and right-censoring. We developed a continuous-time hidden multistate modeling framework to capture transitions among latent multimorbidity patterns while accounting for interval censoring and misclassification. A simulation study compared alternative model specifications under varying sample sizes and follow-up schemes, and the best-performing specification was applied to longitudinal data from the Swedish National study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen (SNAC-K), including 2,716 multimorbid participants followed for up to 18 years. Simulation results showed that hidden multistate models substantially reduced bias in transition hazard estimates compared to non-hidden models, with fully time-inhomogeneous models outperforming piecewise approximations. Application to SNAC-K confirmed the feasibility and practical utility of this framework, enabling identification of risk factors for accelerated progression toward complex multimorbidity and revealing a gradient of mortality risk across patterns. Continuous-time hidden multistate models provide a robust alternative to traditional approaches, supporting individualized predictions and informing targeted interventions and secondary prevention strategies for multimorbidity in aging populations.</p>

                    <h3>Forecasting the Evolving Composition of Inbound Tourism Demand: A Bayesian Compositional Time Series Approach Using Platform Booking Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harrison Katz</p>
                    <p>Understanding how the composition of guest origin markets evolves over time is critical for destination marketing organizations, hospitality businesses, and tourism planners. We develop and apply Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average (BDARMA) models to forecast the compositional dynamics of guest origin market shares using proprietary Airbnb booking data spanning 2017--2024 across four major destination regions. Our analysis reveals substantial pandemic-induced structural breaks in origin composition, with heterogeneous recovery patterns across markets. The BDARMA framework achieves the lowest average forecast error across all destination regions, outperforming standard benchmarks including naïve forecasts, exponential smoothing, and SARIMA on log-ratio transformed data. For EMEA destinations, BDARMA achieves 23% lower forecast error than naive methods, with statistically significant improvements. By modeling compositions directly on the simplex with a Dirichlet likelihood and incorporating seasonal variation in both mean and precision parameters, our approach produces coherent forecasts that respect the unit-sum constraint while capturing complex temporal dependencies. The methodology provides destination stakeholders with probabilistic forecasts of source market shares, enabling more informed strategic planning for marketing resource allocation, infrastructure investment, and crisis response.</p>

                    <h3>Probabilistic Methods for Initial Orbit Determination and Orbit Determination in Cislunar Space</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ishan Paranjape, Tarun Hejmadi, Suman Chakravorty</p>
                    <p>In orbital mechanics, Gauss's method for orbit determination (OD) is a popular, minimal assumption solution for obtaining the initial state estimate of a passing resident space object (RSO). Since much of the cislunar domain relies on three-body dynamics, a key assumption of Gauss's method is rendered incompatible, creating a need for a new, minimal assumption method for initial orbit determination (IOD). In this work, we present a framework for short and long term probabilistic target tracking in cislunar space which produces an initial state estimate with as few assumptions as possible. Specifically, we propose an IOD method involving the kinematic fitting of several series of noisy, consecutive ground-based observations. Once a probabilistic initial state estimate in the form of a particle cloud is formed, we apply the powerful Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) Filter to reduce the uncertainty of our state estimate over time. This combined IOD/OD framework is demonstrated for several classes of trajectories in cislunar space and compared to better-known filtering frameworks.</p>

                    <h3>A context-specific causal model for estimating the effect of extended length of overnight stay on traveller's total expenditure</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauri Valkonen, Juha Karvanen</p>
                    <p>Tourism significantly affects the economies of many countries. Understanding the causal relationship between the length of overnight stay and traveller's expenditure is crucial for stakeholders to characterize spending profiles and to design marketing strategies. Causal mechanisms differ between personal and work-related travel because the decision-making processes have different drivers and constraints. We apply context-specific independence relations to model causal mechanisms in contexts specified by trip purpose and identify the causal effect of the length of stay on expenditure. Using the international visitor survey data on foreign travellers to Finland, we fit a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the posterior distribution of the counterfactual expenditure due to extending the length of stay by one night. We also perform a Bayesian sensitivity analysis of the estimated causal effect with respect to omitted variable bias.</p>

                    <h3>Hybrid Non-informative and Informative Prior Model-assisted Designs for Mid-trial Dose Insertion</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kana Yamada, Hisato Sunami, Kentaro Takeda, Keisuke Hanada, Masahiro Kojima</p>
                    <p>In oncology phase I trials, model-assisted designs have been increasingly adopted because they enable adaptive yet operationally simple dose adjustment based on accumulating safety data, leading to a paradigm shift in dose-escalation methodology. In practice, a single mid-trial dose insertion may be considered to examine safer doses and/or to collect more informative efficacy data. In this study, we investigate methods to improve dose assignment and the selection of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the optimal biological dose (OBD) when a new dose level is added during an ongoing trial under a model-assisted framework, by assigning informative prior information to the inserted dose. We propose a hybrid design that uses a non-informative model-assisted design at trial initiation and, upon dose insertion, applies an informative-prior extension only to the newly added dose. In addition, to address potential skeleton misspecification, we propose two adaptive extensions: (i) an online-weighting approach that updates the skeleton over time, and (ii) a Bayesian-mixture approach that robustly combines multiple candidate skeletons. We evaluate the proposed methods through simulation studies.</p>

                    <h3>Anisotropic local law for non-separable sample covariance matrices</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhou Fan, Renyuan Ma, Elliot Paquette, Zhichao Wang</p>
                    <p>We establish local laws for sample covariance matrices $K = N^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^N \g_i\g_i^*$ where the random vectors $\g_1, \ldots, \g_N \in \R^n$ are independent with common covariance $Σ$. Previous work has largely focused on the separable model $\g = Σ^{1/2}\w$ with $\w$ having independent entries, but this structure is rarely present in statistical applications involving dependent or nonlinearly transformed data. Under a concentration assumption for quadratic forms $\g^*A\g$, we prove an optimal averaged local law showing that the Stieltjes transform of $K$ converges to its deterministic limit uniformly down to the optimal scale $η\geq N^{-1+\eps}$. Under an additional structural assumption on the cumulant tensors of $\g$ -- which interpolates between the highly structured case of independent entries and generic dependence -- we establish the full anisotropic local law, providing entrywise control of the resolvent $(K-zI)^{-1}$ in arbitrary directions. We discuss several classes of non-separable examples satisfying our assumptions, including conditionally mean-zero distributions, the random features model $\g = σ(X\w)$ arising in machine learning, and Gaussian measures with nonlinear tilting. The proofs introduce a tensor network framework for analyzing fluctuation averaging in the presence of higher-order cumulant structure.</p>

                    <h3>huff: A Python package for Market Area Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Wieland</p>
                    <p>Market area models, such as the Huff model and its extensions, are widely used to estimate regional market shares and customer flows of retail and service locations. Another, now very common, area of application is the analysis of catchment areas, supply structures and the accessibility of healthcare locations. The huff Python package provides a complete workflow for market area analysis, including data import, construction of origin-destination interaction matrices, basic model analysis, parameter estimation from empirical data, calculation of distance or travel time indicators, and map visualization. Additionally, the package provides several methods of spatial accessibility analysis. The package is modular and object-oriented. It is intended for researchers in economic geography, regional economics, spatial planning, marketing, geoinformation science, and health geography. The software is openly available via the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/huff/); its development and version history are managed in a public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/geowieland/huff_official) and archived at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18639559).</p>

                    <h3>SOLVAR: Fast covariance-based heterogeneity analysis with pose refinement for cryo-EM</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roey Yadgar, Roy R. Lederman, Yoel Shkolnisky</p>
                    <p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful technique for resolving the three-dimensional structures of macromolecules. A key challenge in cryo-EM is characterizing continuous heterogeneity, where molecules adopt a continuum of conformational states. Covariance-based methods offer a principled approach to modeling structural variability. However, estimating the covariance matrix efficiently remains a challenging computational task. In this paper, we present SOLVAR (Stochastic Optimization for Low-rank Variability Analysis), which leverages a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix to provide a tractable estimator for its principal components, despite the apparently prohibitive large size of the covariance matrix. Under this low-rank assumption, our estimator can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved quickly and accurately. Moreover, our framework enables refinement of the poses of the input particle images, a capability absent from most heterogeneity-analysis methods, and all covariance-based methods. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrate that the algorithm accurately captures dominant components of variability while maintaining computational efficiency. SOLVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets in a recent heterogeneity benchmark. The code of the algorithm is freely available at https://github.com/RoeyYadgar/SOLVAR.</p>

                    <h3>BMW: Bayesian Model-Assisted Adaptive Phase II Clinical Trial Design for Win Ratio Statistic</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Zhu, Yong Zang</p>
                    <p>The win ratio (WR) statistic is increasingly used to evaluate treatment effects based on prioritized composite endpoints, yet existing Bayesian adaptive designs are not directly applicable because the WR is a summary statistic derived from pairwise comparisons and does not correspond to a unique data-generating mechanism. We propose a Bayesian model-assisted adaptive design for randomized phase II clinical trials based on the WR statistic, referred to as the BMW design. The proposed design uses the joint asymptotic distribution of WR test statistics across interim and final analyses to compute posterior probabilities without specifying the underlying outcome distribution. The BMW design allows flexible interim monitoring with early stopping for futility or superiority and is extended to jointly evaluate efficacy and toxicity using a graphical testing procedure that controls the family-wise error rate (FWER). Simulation studies demonstrate that the BMW design maintains valid type I error and FWER control, achieves power comparable to conventional methods, and substantially reduces expected sample size. An R Shiny application is provided to facilitate practical implementation.</p>
