                    <h3>Beyond the Null Effect: Unmasking the True Impact of Teacher-Child Interaction Quality on Child Outcomes in Early Head Start</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> JoonHo Lee, Alison Hooper</p>
                    <p>In Early Head Start (EHS), teacher-child interactions are widely believed to shape infant-toddler outcomes, yet large-scale studies often find only modest or null associations. This study addresses four methodological sources of attenuation -- item-level measurement error, center-level confounding, teacher- and classroom-level covariate imbalance, and overlooked nonlinearities -- to clarify classroom process quality's true influence on child development. Using data from the 2018 wave of the Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (Baby FACES), we applied a three-level generalized additive latent and mixed model (GALAMM) to distinguish genuine classroom-level variability in process quality, as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) and Quality of Caregiver-Child Interactions for Infants and Toddlers (QCIT), from item-level noise and center-level effects. We then estimated dose-response relationships with children's language and socioemotional outcomes, employing covariate balancing weights and generalized additive models. Results show that nearly half of each item's variance reflects classroom-level processes, with the remainder tied to measurement error or center-wide influences, masking true classroom effects. After correcting for these biases, domain-focused dose-response analyses reveal robust linear associations between cognitive/language supports and children's English communicative skills, while emotional-behavioral supports better predict social-emotional competence. Some domains display plateaus when pushed to extremes, underscoring potential nonlinearities. These findings challenge the "null effect" narrative, demonstrating that rigorous methodology can uncover the critical, domain-specific impacts of teacher-child interaction quality, offering clearer guidance for targeted professional development and policy in EHS.</p>

                    <h3>A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Muhle-Karbe, Youssef Ouazzani Chahd, Mathieu Rosenbaum, Grégoire Szymanski</p>
                    <p>We propose a microstructural model for the order flow in financial markets that distinguishes between {\it core orders} and {\it reaction flow}, both modeled as Hawkes processes. This model has a natural scaling limit that reconciles a number of salient empirical properties: persistent signed order flow, rough trading volume and volatility, and power-law market impact. In our framework, all these quantities are pinned down by a single statistic $H_0$, which measures the persistence of the core flow. Specifically, the signed flow converges to the sum of a fractional process with Hurst index $H_0$ and a martingale, while the limiting traded volume is a rough process with Hurst index $H_0-1/2$. No-arbitrage constraints imply that volatility is rough, with Hurst parameter $2H_0-3/2$, and that the price impact of trades follows a power law with exponent $2-2H_0$. The analysis of signed order flow data yields an estimate $H_0 \approx 3/4$. This is not only consistent with the square-root law of market impact, but also turns out to match estimates for the roughness of traded volumes and volatilities remarkably well.</p>

                    <h3>Learning to Defer in Non-Stationary Time Series via Switching State-Space Models</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannis Montreuil, Letian Yu, Axel Carlier, Lai Xing Ng, Wei Tsang Ooi</p>
                    <p>We study Learning to Defer for non-stationary time series with partial feedback and time-varying expert availability. At each time step, the router selects an available expert, observes the target, and sees only the queried expert's prediction. We model signed expert residuals using L2D-SLDS, a factorized switching linear-Gaussian state-space model with context-dependent regime transitions, a shared global factor enabling cross-expert information transfer, and per-expert idiosyncratic states. The model supports expert entry and pruning via a dynamic registry. Using one-step-ahead predictive beliefs, we propose an IDS-inspired routing rule that trades off predicted cost against information gained about the latent regime and shared factor. Experiments show improvements over contextual-bandit baselines and a no-shared-factor ablation.</p>

                    <h3>Changepoint Detection As Model Selection: A General Framework</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Grantham, Xueheng Shi, Bertrand Clarke</p>
                    <p>This dissertation presents a general framework for changepoint detection based on L0 model selection. The core method, Iteratively Reweighted Fused Lasso (IRFL), improves upon the generalized lasso by adaptively reweighting penalties to enhance support recovery and minimize criteria such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The approach allows for flexible modeling of seasonal patterns, linear and quadratic trends, and autoregressive dependence in the presence of changepoints.
  Simulation studies demonstrate that IRFL achieves accurate changepoint detection across a wide range of challenging scenarios, including those involving nuisance factors such as trends, seasonal patterns, and serially correlated errors. The framework is further extended to image data, where it enables edge-preserving denoising and segmentation, with applications spanning medical imaging and high-throughput plant phenotyping.
  Applications to real-world data demonstrate IRFL's utility. In particular, analysis of the Mauna Loa CO2 time series reveals changepoints that align with volcanic eruptions and ENSO events, yielding a more accurate trend decomposition than ordinary least squares. Overall, IRFL provides a robust, extensible tool for detecting structural change in complex data.</p>

                    <h3>It's all the (Exponential) Family: An Equivalence between Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Control Variates for Sketching Algorithms</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keegan Kang, Kerong Wang, Ding Zhang, Rameshwar Pratap, Bhisham Dev Verma, Benedict H. W. Wong</p>
                    <p>Maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) and control variate estimators (CVE) have been used in conjunction with known information across sketching algorithms and applications in machine learning. We prove that under certain conditions in an exponential family, an optimal CVE will achieve the same asymptotic variance as the MLE, giving an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the MLE. Experiments show the EM algorithm is faster and numerically stable compared to other root finding algorithms for the MLE for the bivariate Normal distribution, and we expect this to hold across distributions satisfying these conditions. We show how the EM algorithm leads to reproducibility for algorithms using MLE / CVE, and demonstrate how the EM algorithm leads to finding the MLE when the CV weights are known.</p>

                    <h3>Label-Efficient Monitoring of Classification Models via Stratified Importance Sampling</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lupo Marsigli, Angel Lopez de Haro</p>
                    <p>Monitoring the performance of classification models in production is critical yet challenging due to strict labeling budgets, one-shot batch acquisition of labels and extremely low error rates. We propose a general framework based on Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS) that directly addresses these constraints in model monitoring. While SIS has previously been applied in specialized domains, our theoretical analysis establishes its broad applicability to the monitoring of classification models. Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains. Experiments across binary and multiclass tasks demonstrate consistent efficiency improvements under fixed label budgets, underscoring SIS as a principled, label-efficient, and operationally lightweight methodology for post-deployment model monitoring.</p>

                    <h3>A Time-Varying Branching Process Approach to Model Self-Renewing Cells</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huyen Nguyen, Haim Bar, Zhiyi Chi, Vladimir Pozdnyakov</p>
                    <p>Stem cells, through their ability to produce daughter stem cells and differentiate into specialized cells, are essential in the growth, maintenance, and repair of biological tissues. Understanding the dynamics of cell populations in the proliferation process not only uncovers proliferative properties of stem cells, but also offers insight into tissue development under both normal conditions and pathological disruption. In this paper, we develop a continuous time branching process model with time-dependent offspring distribution to characterize stem cell proliferation process. We derive analytical expressions for mean, variance, and autocovariance of the stem cell counts, and develop likelihood-based inference procedures to estimate model parameters. Particularly, we construct a forward algorithm likelihood to handle situations when some cell types cannot be directly observed. Simulation results demonstrate that our estimation method recovers the time-dependent division probabilities with good accuracy.</p>

                    <h3>Social Media Data for Population Mapping: A Bayesian Approach to Address Representativeness and Privacy Challenges</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Andrich, Shengjie Lai, Halim Jun, Qianwen Duan, Zhifeng Cheng, Seth R. Flaxman, Andrew J. Tatem</p>
                    <p>Accurate and timely population data are essential for disaster response and humanitarian planning, but traditional censuses often cannot capture rapid demographic changes. Social media data offer a promising alternative for dynamic population monitoring, but their representativeness remains poorly understood and stringent privacy requirements limit their reliability. Here, we address these limitations in the context of the Philippines by calibrating Facebook user counts with the country's 2020 census figures. First, we find that differential privacy techniques commonly applied to social media-based population datasets disproportionately mask low-population areas. To address this, we propose a Bayesian imputation approach to recover missing values, restoring data coverage for $5.5\%$ of rural areas. Further, using the imputed social media data and leveraging predictors such as urbanisation level, demographic composition, and socio-economic status, we develop a statistical model for the proportion of Facebook users in each municipality, which links observed Facebook user numbers to the true population levels. Out-of-sample validation demonstrates strong result generalisability, with errors as low as ${\approx}18\%$ and ${\approx}24\%$ for urban and rural Facebook user proportions, respectively. We further demonstrate that accounting for overdispersion and spatial correlations in the data is crucial to obtain accurate estimates and appropriate credible intervals. Crucially, as predictors change over time, the models can be used to regularly update the population predictions, providing a dynamic complement to census-based estimates. These results have direct implications for humanitarian response in disaster-prone regions and offer a general framework for using biased social media signals to generate reliable and timely population data.</p>

                    <h3>Clustering Methods for Identifying and Modelling Areas with Similar Temperature Variations</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Otranto</p>
                    <p>This paper proposes a novel data-driven approach for identifying and modelling areas with similar temperature variations throufigureh clustering and Space-Time AutoRegressive (STAR) models. Using annual temperature data from 168 countries (1901-2022), we apply three clustering methods based on (i) warming rates, (ii) annual temperature variations, and (iii) persistence of variation signs, using Euclidean and Hamming distances. These clusters are then employed to construct alternative spatial weight matrices for STAR models. Empirical results show that distance-based STAR models outperform classical contiguity-based ones, both in-sample and out-of-sample, with the Hamming distance-based STAR model achieving the best predictive accuracy. The study demonstrates that using statistical similarity rather than geographical proximity improves the modelling of global temperature dynamics, suggesting broader applicability to other environmental and socioeconomic datasets.</p>

                    <h3>A Poisson Factor Mixture Model for the Analysis of Linguistic Competence in Italian University Students' Writing</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silvia Dallari, Laura Anderlucci, Nicola Grandi, Angela Montanari</p>
                    <p>Public debate on the alleged decline of language skills among younger generations often focuses on university students, the most highly educated segment of the population. Rather than addressing the ill posed question of linguistic decline, this paper examines how formal written Italian is currently used by university students and whether systematic patterns of competence and heterogeneity can be identified. The analysis is based on data from the UniversITA project, which collected formal texts written by a large and nationally representative sample of Italian university students. Texts were annotated for linguistically motivated features covering orthography, lexicon, syntax, morphosyntax, coherence, register, and sentence structure, yielding low frequency multivariate count data. To analyse these data, we propose a novel model-based clustering approach based on a Poisson factor mixture model that accounts for dependence among linguistic features and unobserved population heterogeneity. The results identify two correlated dimensions of writing competence, interpretable as communicative competence and linguistic grammatical competence. When educational and socio demographic information is incorporated, distinct student profiles emerge that are associated with field of study and educational background. These findings provide quantitative evidence on contemporary writing and offer insights relevant for language education and higher education policy.</p>
