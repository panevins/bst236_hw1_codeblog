                    <h3>Identifying Treatment Effect Heterogeneity with Bayesian Hierarchical
  Adjustable Random Partition in Adaptive Enrichment Trials</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianglin Zhao, Shirin Golchi, Jean-Philippe Gouin, Kaberi Dasgupta</p>
                    <p>  Treatment effect heterogeneity refers to the systematic variation in
treatment effects across subgroups. There is an increasing need for clinical
trials that aim to investigate treatment effect heterogeneity and estimate
subgroup-specific responses. While several statistical methods have been
proposed to address this problem, existing partitioning-based methods often
depend on auxiliary analysis, overlook model uncertainty, or impose inflexible
borrowing strength. We propose the Bayesian Hierarchical Adjustable Random
Partition (BHARP) model, a self-contained framework that applies a finite
mixture model with an unknown number of components to explore the partition
space accounting for model uncertainty. The BHARP model jointly estimates
subgroup-specific effects and the heterogeneity patterns, and adjusts the
borrowing strengths based on within-cluster cohesion without requiring manual
calibration. Posterior sampling is performed via a custom reversible-jump
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler tailored to partitioning-based information
borrowing in clinical trials. Simulation studies across a range of treatment
effect heterogeneity patterns show that the BHARP model achieves better
accuracy and precision compared to conventional and advanced methods. We
showcase the utilities of the BHARP model in the context of a multi-arm
adaptive enrichment trial investigating physical activity interventions in
patients with type 2 diabetes.

                    <h3>Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA) of General Insurers under Climate
  Change</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Avanzi, Yanfeng Li, Greg Taylor, Bernard Wong</p>
                    <p>  Climate change is expected to significantly affect the physical, financial,
and economic environments over the long term, posing risks to the financial
health of general insurers. While general insurers typically use Dynamic
Financial Analysis (DFA) for a comprehensive view of financial impacts,
traditional DFA as presented in the literature does not consider the impact of
climate change. To address this gap, we introduce a climate-dependent DFA
approach that integrates climate risk into DFA, providing a holistic assessment
of the long-term impact of climate change on the general insurance industry.
The proposed framework has three key features. First, it captures the long-term
impact of climate change on the assets and liabilities of general insurers by
considering both physical and economic dimensions across different climate
scenarios within an interconnected structure. Second, it addresses the
uncertainty of climate change impacts using stochastic simulations within
climate scenario analysis that are useful for actuarial applications. Finally,
the framework is tailored to the general insurance sector by addressing its
unique characteristics. To demonstrate the practical application of our model,
we conduct an extensive empirical study using Australian data to assess the
long-term financial impact of climate change on the general insurance market
under various climate scenarios. The results show that the interaction between
economic growth and physical risk plays a key role in shaping general insurers'
risk-return profiles. Limitations of our framework are thoroughly discussed.

                    <h3>Multivariate Shared Frailty Cure-Rate models: a focus on Breast Cancer
  family history</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Veronica Vinattieri, Marco Bonetti, Kamila Czene</p>
                    <p>  We discuss a shift in perspective from traditional approaches to breast
cancer risk prediction: modelling families rather than individuals as unit of
analysis. By investigating the latent familial risk underlying breast cancer
diagnoses, we introduce a Multivariate Shared Frailty Cure-Rate model. This
model captures the familial risk as a shared frailty among members and
explicitly accounts for a fraction of women not susceptible to breast cancer.
We aim at identifying the high-risk families to better target screening and
prevention, ultimately improving early detection. A comparative analysis with
Cox models and univariate models - where a binary risk indicator acts as best
guess for the latent high-risk group - is conducted using simulation studies
and data from the Swedish Multi-Generational Breast Cancer registry. We
demonstrate the critical importance of using complete family history of breast
cancer to accurately identify high-risk families and show that the Multivariate
Shared Frailty Cure-Rate model, capturing both the fraction of non-susceptible
subjects and the survival distribution among susceptibles, enhances explanatory
power, improves prediction accuracy, and offers a broader representation of the
disease process.

                    <h3>A regularized multi-state model for covariate selection with
  interval-censored survival data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ariane Bercu, Agathe Guilloux, Cécile Proust-Lima, Hélène Jacqmin-Gadda</p>
                    <p>  In population-based cohorts, disease diagnoses are typically censored by
intervals as made during scheduled follow-up visits. The exact disease onset
time is thus unknown, and in the presence of semi-competing risk of death,
subjects may also die in between two visits before any diagnosis can be made.
Illness-death models can be used to handle uncertainty about illness timing and
the possible absence of diagnosis due to death. However, they are so far
limited in the number of covariates. We developed a regularized estimation
procedure for illness-death models with interval-censored illness diagnosis
that performs variable selection in the case of high-dimensional predictors. We
considered a proximal gradient hybrid algorithm maximizing the regularized
likelihood with an elastic-net penalty. The algorithm simultaneously estimates
the regression parameters of the three transitions under proportional
transition intensities with transition-specific penalty parameters determined
in an outer gridsearch. The algorithm, implemented in the R package HIDeM,
shows high performances in predicting illness probability, as well as correct
selection of transition-specific risk factors across different simulation
scenarios. In comparison, the cause-specific competing risk model neglecting
interval-censoring systematically showed worse predictive ability and tended to
select irrelevant illness predictors, originally associated with death. Applied
to the population-based cohort Three-City, the method identified predictors of
clinical dementia onset among a large set of brain imaging, cognitive and
clinical markers.

                    <h3>Evaluation of Time Series Forecasting Models for Predicting Lung Cancer
  Mortality Rates in the United States: A Comparison with Altuhaifa (2023)
  Study</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Kubuafor, D. Baidoo, O. J. Okeke, R. Amevor, G. Arhin, J. T. Korley</p>
                    <p>  This paper evaluates the performance of the following time series forecasting
models - Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holt's Double Exponential
Smoothing (HDES), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) - in
predicting lung cancer mortality rates in the United States. It builds upon the
work of Altuhaifa, which used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) data from 1975-2018 to evaluate these models. Altuhaifa's study found
that ARIMA (0,2,2), SES with smoothing parameter $\alpha=0.995$, and HDES with
parameters $\alpha=0.4$ and $\beta=0.9$ were the optimal models from their
analysis, with HDES providing the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of
132.91. The paper extends the dataset to 2021 and re-evaluates the models.
Using the same SEER data from 1975-2021, it identifies ARIMA (0,2,2), SES
($\alpha=0.999$), and HDES ($\alpha=0.5221$, $\beta=0.5219$) as the
best-fitting models. Interestingly, ARIMA (0,2,2) and HDES yield the lowest
RMSE of 2.56. To obtain forecasts with higher accuracy, an average model
(HDES-ARIMA) consisting of HDES and ARIMA was constructed to leverage their
strengths. The HDES-ARIMA model also achieves an RMSE of 2.56. The forecast
from the average model suggests declining lung cancer mortality rates in the
United States. The study highlights how expanding datasets and re-evaluating
models can provide updated insights. It recommends further analysis using
monthly data separated by gender, ethnicity, and state to understand lung
cancer mortality dynamics in the United States. Overall, advanced time series
methods like HDES and ARIMA show strong potential for accurately forecasting
this major public health issue.

                    <h3>Comparing Malaria Trends in the Comoros Islands: ARIMA Modeling and
  Retrospective Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Baidoo, E. Kubuafor, O. O. Joshua, S. F. Osarfo, F. A. Agyei-Owusu, J. Akuoko-Frimpong, N. Appiah, A. Duah, R. Amevor, F. E. Boateng, F. Aboagye, B. Benyi</p>
                    <p>  Malaria remains a serious health challenge in the Comoros Islands, despite
ongoing control efforts. Past studies have shown reductions in cases due to
prevention and treatment measures, but little work has been done to forecast
future malaria deaths and assess the long-term impact of these measures.
Malaria mortality data from 1990 to 2019 were analyzed using an ARIMA(1,0,0)
model. The model was validated through diagnostic tests, ensuring reliability
for forecasting trends. The study confirmed significant reductions in malaria
cases, such as in Grand Comoro, where cases fell from 235.36 to 5.47 per 1,000
people. The ARIMA model predicted that fatalities will remain low if current
control measures, including bed nets, indoor spraying, and mass drug
administration, are sustained. The findings highlight the success of these
interventions in reducing malaria mortality. However, challenges like drug and
insecticide resistance and financial limitations pose risks to further
progress. Continued support and adaptation of strategies are essential to
address these challenges and sustain low malaria mortality rates. The study
demonstrates the effectiveness of malaria control efforts in the Comoros and
underscores the importance of maintaining these measures to achieve malaria
elimination and improve public health outcomes.

                    <h3>A nonstationary spatial model of PM2.5 with localized transfer learning
  from numerical model output</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenlong Gong, Brian J. Reich, Joseph Guinness</p>
                    <p>  Ambient air pollution measurements from regulatory monitoring networks are
routinely used to support epidemiologic studies and environmental policy
decision making. However, regulatory monitors are spatially sparse and
preferentially located in areas with large populations. Numerical air pollution
model output can be leveraged into the inference and prediction of air
pollution data combining with measurements from monitors. Nonstationary
covariance functions allow the model to adapt to spatial surfaces whose
variability changes with location like air pollution data. In the paper, we
employ localized covariance parameters learned from the numerical output model
to knit together into a global nonstationary covariance, to incorporate in a
fully Bayesian model. We model the nonstationary structure in a computationally
efficient way to make the Bayesian model scalable.

                    <h3>Dynamic Graph-Based Forecasts of Bookmakers' Odds in Professional Tennis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew J Penn, Jed Michael, Samir Bhatt</p>
                    <p>  Bookmakers' odds consistently provide one of the most accurate methods for
predicting the results of professional tennis matches. However, these odds
usually only become available shortly before a match takes place, limiting
their usefulness as an analysis tool. To ameliorate this issue, we introduce a
novel dynamic graph-based model which aims to forecast bookmaker odds for any
match on any surface, allowing effective and detailed pre-tournament
predictions to be made. By leveraging the high-quality information contained in
the odds, our model can keep pace with new innovations in tennis modelling. By
analysing major tennis championships from 2024 and 2025, we show that our model
achieves comparable accuracy both to the bookmakers and other models in the
literature, while significantly outperforming rankings-based predictions.

                    <h3>Variable Neighborhood Descent Methods for Large-scale Single-assignment
  Multi-level Facility Location Problem</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haibo Wang, Bahram Alidaee</p>
                    <p>  This paper addresses the single--assignment uncapacitated multi-level
facility location (MFL) problem, which has numerous applications, including
tactical and strategic supply chain management. We consider four-level and
five-level facilities (4-LFL and 5-LFL). Although the MFL has been addressed in
the literature in various settings, solutions to large-scale, realistic
problems are still lacking. This paper considers several variants of the
variable neighborhood descent (VND) method, including BVND, PVND, CVND, and
UVND, for the problem. In each case, a multi-start strategy with strong
diversification components is provided. Extensive computational experiments are
presented to compare methods for large-scale problems involving up to 10,000
customers, 150 distribution centers, 50 warehouses, and 30 plants in the case
of 4-LFL; and 8,000 customers, 150 distribution centers, 50 warehouses, 50
plants, and 100 suppliers in the case of 5-LFL. Sensitivity analyses, supported
by appropriate statistical methods, validate the effectiveness of the
heuristics' results.

                    <h3>Gerrymandering and geographic polarization have reduced electoral
  competition</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Jasny, Christopher T. Kenny, Cory McCartan, Tyler Simko, Melissa Wu, Michael Y. Zhao, Aneetej Arora, Emma Ebowe, Philip O'Sullivan, Taran Samarth, Kosuke Imai</p>
                    <p>  Changes in political geography and electoral district boundaries shape
representation in the United States Congress. To disentangle the effects of
geography and gerrymandering, we generate a large ensemble of alternative
redistricting plans that follow each state's legal criteria. Comparing enacted
plans to these simulations reveals partisan bias, while changes in the
simulated plans over time identify shifts in political geography. Our analysis
shows that geographic polarization has intensified between 2010 and 2020:
Republicans improved their standing in rural and rural-suburban areas, while
Democrats further gained in urban districts. These shifts offset nationally,
reducing the Republican geographic advantage from 14 to 10 seats. Additionally,
pro-Democratic gerrymandering in 2020 counteracted earlier Republican efforts,
reducing the GOP redistricting advantage by two seats. In total, the
pro-Republican bias declined from 16 to 10 seats. Crucially, shifts in
political geography and gerrymandering reduced the number of highly competitive
districts by over 25%, with geographic polarization driving most of the
decline.
